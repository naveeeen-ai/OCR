**Question 10:**
**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter crucial for muscle contraction. Acetylcholinesterase breaks it down, terminating the signal.  Increased acetylcholinesterase would lead to quicker breakdown of acetylcholine, resulting in weaker muscle contractions and ultimately, weakness of muscle movements.


**Question 11:**
**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** The adrenal glands are vital in the stress response.  Cortisol (B) is a key adrenal hormone mediating this response. They produce both hormones (like cortisol and aldosterone) and neurotransmitters (like epinephrine and norepinephrine). (C) is true.  While the adrenal glands produce small amounts of sex hormones,  the statement that they release estrogen in males and testosterone in females (D) is inaccurate; the gonads are the primary source of these hormones. Option A is incorrect because the fight-or-flight response is primarily mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine, not estrogen.


**Question 12:**
**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** The pineal gland produces melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. A disorder of the pineal gland would therefore most likely disrupt these cycles, leading to insomnia (C).


**Question 13:**
**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Dopamine is implicated in both schizophrenia (where an excess is often observed) and Parkinson's disease (where a deficiency is seen).


**Question 14:**
**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Identical twins (monozygotic) share 100% of their genes.  While environment plays a role, identical twins raised in the same home would share the most similar environments and thus be expected to score most similarly on a personality survey compared to any other twin pairing.


**Question 15:**
**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** The Babinski reflex is a primitive reflex where the toes fan out when the bottom of the foot is stroked.  In adults, this reflex is typically absent. Curling of the toes towards the bottom of the foot (plantar flexion) is the normal adult response.  The described response in the 50-year-old patient with multiple sclerosis is abnormal, indicating a persistence of the Babinski reflex (a primitive reflex).


**Question 16:**
**Answer: B**
**Explanation:**  Infants develop fine motor skills gradually.  Following objects with their eyes (B) is a very early visual motor skill that develops before grasping, scribbling, or transferring objects between hands. These latter skills require more coordination and muscle control.
