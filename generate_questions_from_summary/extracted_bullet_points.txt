1. The SI units include meter, kilogram, second, ampère, mole, kelvin, and candela.
2. Vectors have both magnitude and direction.
3. Scalars have only magnitude.
4. Displacement is a vector representing change in position.
5. Distance is a scalar representing path length.
6. Velocity is the rate of change of displacement.
7. Speed is the magnitude of velocity.
8. Average velocity is total displacement divided by total time.
9. Average speed is total distance divided by total time.
10. Instantaneous velocity is the limit of Δdisplacement/Δtime as Δtime approaches zero.
11. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.
12. A force is a push or pull causing acceleration.
13. Gravity is an attractive force between masses.
14. Friction opposes motion due to surface interactions.
15. Static friction acts on objects at rest relative to each other.
16. Kinetic friction acts on objects in motion relative to each other.
17. Kinetic friction is constant; static friction varies.
18. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials in contact.
19. The coefficient of static friction is greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
20. Mass is a measure of inertia.
21. Weight is the force due to gravity on an object.
22. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
23. Newton's first law is the law of inertia.
24. Newton's second law states F = ma.
25. Newton's third law states that forces come in equal and opposite pairs.
26. Linear motion has parallel or antiparallel velocity and acceleration vectors.
27. Projectile motion involves both horizontal and vertical components.
28. In projectile motion with negligible air resistance, only gravity acts.
29. Inclined plane problems often involve parallel and perpendicular components.
30. Circular motion involves radial and tangential components.
31. In uniform circular motion, the only force is centripetal force.
32. Free body diagrams represent forces acting on an object.
33. Translational equilibrium means zero net force.
34. An object in translational equilibrium has constant velocity.
35. Rotational equilibrium means zero net torque.
36. Rotational equilibrium has constant angular velocity (usually zero on the MCAT).
