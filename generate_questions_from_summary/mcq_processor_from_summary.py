Make sure to cover various topics from the summary including:
- Kinematics concepts (displacement, velocity, acceleration, motion equations)
- Dynamics concepts (forces, Newton's laws, momentum, energy)
- Mathematical relationships and formulas
- Real-world applications and examples
- MCAT-style problem-solving scenarios

For each question, provide:
1. A clear, educational question suitable for MCAT preparation
2. Four answer choices (A, B, C, D)
3. Make sure only one choice is clearly correct
4. Include both conceptual and calculation-based questions typical of MCAT physics
5. Focus on critical thinking and application skills required for MCAT

Format each question as:

A. Answer choice 1 text
B. Answer choice 2 text  
C. Answer choice 3 text
D. Answer choice 4 text

Example format:
What is the formula for acceleration?
A. v = u + at
B. a = (v - u) / t
C. s = ut + (1/2)atÂ²
D. F = ma
B. a = (v - u) / t
Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. The formula a = (v - u) / t represents this relationship where 'v' is final velocity, 'u' is initial velocity, and 't' is time. This concept is fundamental for MCAT physics problems involving motion analysis.
