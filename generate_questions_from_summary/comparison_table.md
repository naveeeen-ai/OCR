Which of the following represents the correct vector operation to find the plane's displacement excluding the wind's influence?<br/>A. P + W<br/>B. P - W<br/>C. W - P<br/>D. -P - W<br/>Answer: B. P - W<br/>Explanation: To find the displacement without wind, we need to subtract the wind's effect (W) from the total displacement (P). This uses the concept that vector subtraction isolates the desired vector by removing the contribution of another.<br/><br/>5c. An object undergoes two successive displacements. Which of the following is true about subtracting the first displacement vector from the second displacement vector?<br/>A. It will always result in a vector with a smaller magnitude than either original displacement vector.<br/>B. It is equivalent to adding the second displacement vector to the negative of the first displacement vector.<br/>C. It will result in a scalar quantity representing the change in distance.<br/>D. It cannot be performed because displacement vectors are always positive.<br/>Answer: B. It is equivalent to adding the second displacement vector to the negative of the first displacement vector.<br/>Explanation: The fundamental principle of vector subtraction involves changing the direction of the subtracted vector and then adding it.

Only the direction of the vector changes.<br/>C. Both the magnitude and direction of the vector change.<br/>D. Neither the magnitude nor the direction of the vector changes.<br/>Answer: C. Both the magnitude and direction of the vector change.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying by a negative scalar alters the vector's magnitude by the absolute value of the scalar and reverses its direction by 180 degrees. Thus both properties are affected.<br/><br/>6b. Question text<br/>A displacement vector is multiplied by a scalar value. Under which of the following conditions will the magnitude of the resultant displacement vector be decreased compared to the initial displacement vector?<br/>A. The scalar is any positive number greater than 1.<br/>B. The scalar is any negative number less than -1.<br/>C. The scalar is any positive number less than 1.<br/>D. The scalar is exactly 1.<br/>Answer: C. The scalar is any positive number less than 1.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar less than one decreases its magnitude; multiplying by a negative scalar less than one also decreases the magnitude because we consider the absolute value of the scalar. A and B increase magnitude; D leaves it unchanged.<br/><br/>6c. Question text<br/>A force vector, F, is multiplied by an unknown scalar 'k' to produce a new force vector, F'. If the direction of F' is opposite to that of F, which of the following statements must be true regarding 'k'?<br/>A. k must be a complex number.<br/>B. k must be zero.<br/>C. k must be a negative number.<br/>D. k must be a positive number.<br/>Answer: C. k must be a negative number.<br/>Explanation: Only a negative scalar can reverse the direction of a vector.

Proportional to the average speed<br/>D. Dependent on the trail's maximum elevation<br/>Answer: B. Equal to zero<br/>Explanation: Displacement is a vector quantity representing the change in position. Since the hiker returns to the starting point, there is no net change in position, resulting in zero displacement regardless of the path taken.<br/><br/>9b. Two objects move from point A to point B. Object 1 takes a curved path, while object 2 takes a straight path. Which of the following statements is true regarding their displacements?<br/>A. Object 1's displacement is greater than object 2's.<br/>B. Object 2's displacement is greater than object 1's.<br/>C. Their displacements are equal.<br/>D. The relationship between their displacements depends on their average speeds.<br/>Answer: C. Their displacements are equal.<br/>Explanation: Displacement is path-independent; it only considers the initial and final positions. Since both objects start at A and end at B, their displacements are identical, irrespective of their trajectories.<br/><br/>9c. Which of the following scenarios illustrates a situation where an object's displacement magnitude and distance traveled are equal?<br/>A. A car driving around a circular track at a constant speed.<br/>B. A ball thrown vertically upward, returning to the same height.<br/>C.

Distance can be negative, indicating a change in direction.<br/>Answer: B. Distance only requires magnitude for its complete description.<br/>Explanation: Scalar quantities, like distance, are fully described by their magnitude alone. Direction is irrelevant, unlike vector quantities. The MCAT emphasizes distinguishing between scalar and vector quantities.<br/><br/>10b. A hiker traverses a winding trail. Which statement accurately describes the relationship between the total distance the hiker travels and the straight-line displacement from their starting point?<br/>A. The distance will always be less than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement.<br/>B. The distance and the magnitude of the displacement will always be equal.<br/>C. The distance will always be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement.<br/>D. The distance is independent of the displacement, as they measure different properties.<br/>Answer: C. The distance will always be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement.<br/>Explanation: Distance accounts for the entire path traveled, whereas displacement is the shortest straight-line path. Therefore, the distance must be equal to or longer than the displacement's magnitude, testing conceptual understanding of these definitions.<br/><br/>10c. Two objects move from point A to point B. Object 1 follows a direct straight path. Object 2 follows a curved, longer path. Which of the following quantities must be different for the two objects?<br/>A. Final velocity.<br/>B. Final kinetic energy.<br/>C. Distance traveled.<br/>D. Average acceleration.<br/>Answer: C. Distance traveled.<br/>Explanation: Since Object 2 travels a longer path than Object 1, the distance traveled by each object must be different.

The car's velocity is changing because its direction is changing.<br/>Explanation: Velocity is a vector, possessing both magnitude (speed) and direction. Even with constant speed, a changing direction implies a changing velocity. A circular path inherently involves continuous directional changes.<br/><br/>11c. Question text<br/>Consider two objects, A and B. Object A has a greater change in displacement over the same time interval as object B. Which of the following must be true?<br/>A. Object A has a greater average acceleration than object B.<br/>B. Object A has a greater average speed than object B.<br/>C. Object A has a greater average velocity magnitude than object B.<br/>D. Object A and object B experience the same net force.<br/>Answer: C. Object A has a greater average velocity magnitude than object B.<br/>Explanation: Average velocity is displacement divided by time.

Driving from one city to another in a straight line without reversing<br/>C. Walking back and forth along the same path multiple times<br/>D. Cycling in a circle and stopping where you began<br/>Answer: B. Driving from one city to another in a straight line without reversing<br/>Explanation: When motion occurs in a straight line without changing direction, total distance equals displacement, making average speed equal to the magnitude of average velocity. | 13a. A race car completes a lap on a circular track. What can be definitively stated about the car's average speed for that lap?<br/>A.

It is greater than zero.<br/>Explanation: Average speed is the total distance divided by total time. Since the car covered a distance (the circumference of the track) in a non-zero time, the average speed must be greater than zero. The race car is always moving, so the average speed is always a positive quantity.<br/><br/>13b. Two runners complete a 100-meter dash. Runner A completes the race in 10 seconds, while Runner B completes the race in 12 seconds. Which of the following is true regarding the average speeds of the runners?<br/>A. The average speed of Runner A is greater because they covered the same distance in less time.<br/>B. The average speed of Runner B is greater because they had a lower instantaneous speed at the finish line.<br/>C. The average speeds are equal because the displacement is the same for both runners.<br/>D. The average speed cannot be determined without knowing the instantaneous speeds at various points in the race.<br/>Answer: A. The average speed of Runner A is greater because they covered the same distance in less time.<br/>Explanation: Since average speed is total distance divided by total time, the runner who covers the same distance in less time has a higher average speed. Average speed considers the entire duration and distance, not just the final moment.<br/><br/>13c. A child walks 5 meters east, then 5 meters north, then 5 meters west. If the entire trip takes 30 seconds, which statement is correct?<br/>A. The average speed is zero because the child ends up close to where they started.<br/>B. The average speed is 1 m/s.<br/>C. The average speed is 0.5 m/s.<br/>D. The average speed is less than the magnitude of the average velocity.<br/>Answer: C. The average speed is 0.5 m/s.<br/>Explanation: Average speed is total distance (5+5+5 = 15m) divided by total time (30s), so 15m/30s = 0.5 m/s. Distance is path dependent while average speed considers the total scalar distance and not the vector displacement. | - |

Electrostatic interactions between the surfaces' constituent atoms.<br/>Explanation: Friction arises from the numerous attractive and repulsive electrostatic forces between the atoms and molecules making up the surfaces. Although the overall surface may appear smooth, on the atomic level, there are many points of contact and interaction. These electrostatic interactions resist the relative motion of the surfaces.<br/><br/>18b. Question text<br/>A wooden block is sliding down an inclined plane at a constant velocity. Which of the following statements is true regarding the forces acting on the block?<br/>A. The component of gravity down the plane is equal to the normal force.<br/>B. The component of gravity down the plane is equal to the force of kinetic friction.<br/>C. The normal force is equal to the force of kinetic friction.<br/>D. The block experiences no net force because it is moving at a constant velocity.<br/>Answer: B. The component of gravity down the plane is equal to the force of kinetic friction.<br/>Explanation: Since the block is moving at a constant velocity (i.e., no acceleration), the net force on the block must be zero. This means the force of kinetic friction opposing the motion must be equal in magnitude to the component of gravity acting down the inclined plane.<br/><br/>18c. Question text<br/>Increasing the surface area of contact between two solid objects will most likely affect the frictional force between them in which of the following ways?<br/>A. Always increase the static and kinetic frictional forces.<br/>B. Always decrease the static and kinetic frictional forces.<br/>C. Have no effect on the static and kinetic frictional forces.<br/>D. Increase the static frictional force but decrease the kinetic frictional force.<br/>Answer: C. Have no effect on the static and kinetic frictional forces.<br/>Explanation: The frictional force is primarily dependent on the normal force and the coefficient of friction between the two surfaces. Surface area does not play a role in the magnitude of the frictional force unless it affects the normal force or coefficient of friction (e.g., through deformation). | - |
| 19 | Static friction exists between two objects that are not in motion relative to each other. | 19a. Which of the following best describes the condition under which static friction acts between two surfaces?<br/>A. When the surfaces are moving relative to each other<br/>B. When the surfaces are at rest relative to each other<br/>C. When both surfaces are accelerating together<br/>D. When only one surface is stationary<br/>Answer: B. When the surfaces are at rest relative to each other<br/>Explanation: Static friction acts to prevent relative motion between two surfaces that are not moving with respect to each other, distinguishing it from kinetic friction.<br/><br/>19b. A block rests on an inclined plane and does not slide down. Which force is primarily responsible for preventing the block from moving?<br/>A. Gravitational force<br/>B. Normal force<br/>C. Static friction<br/>D. Kinetic friction<br/>Answer: C. Static friction<br/>Explanation: Static friction is the force that counteracts the component of gravity parallel to the plane, preventing the block from sliding as long as the surfaces remain stationary relative to each other.<br/><br/>19c. Which scenario correctly identifies when static friction, rather than kinetic friction, is present?<br/>A. A hockey puck sliding across ice<br/>B. A car parked on a sloped driveway<br/>C. A sled moving down a snowy hill<br/>D. A coin spinning on a table<br/>Answer: B. A car parked on a sloped driveway<br/>Explanation: Static friction acts when there is no relative motion between the contacting surfaces, as with a stationary car on a slope, whereas kinetic friction applies to sliding objects. | - | - |
| 20 | Kinetic friction exists between two objects that are in motion relative to each other. | 20a. Which of the following best describes the condition required for kinetic friction to act between two surfaces?<br/>A. The surfaces must be at rest relative to each other.<br/>B. The surfaces must be moving relative to each other.<br/>C. The surfaces must be accelerating together.<br/>D. The surfaces must be separated by a thin layer of fluid.<br/>Answer: B.

A block rests on a horizontal surface. Which scenario will result in kinetic friction acting on the block?<br/>A. The block remains stationary despite an applied force.<br/>B. The block is pushed and slides across the surface.<br/>C. The block is lifted vertically off the surface.<br/>D. The block is attached to a spring but does not move.<br/>Answer: B. The block is pushed and slides across the surface.<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction occurs when there is relative motion (sliding) between the block and the surface, not when the block is stationary or not in contact.<br/><br/>20c. Which statement correctly distinguishes kinetic friction from static friction?<br/>A. Kinetic friction prevents objects from starting to move.<br/>B. Kinetic friction acts when two surfaces are at rest relative to each other.<br/>C. Kinetic friction acts only when there is relative sliding motion between surfaces.<br/>D. Kinetic friction is always greater than static friction.<br/>Answer: C. Kinetic friction acts only when there is relative sliding motion between surfaces.<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction specifically refers to the resistive force present during sliding motion, whereas static friction acts before motion begins. | - | - |
| 21 | Whereas static friction can take on many values depending on the magnitude of an applied force, kinetic friction is a constant value. | 21a. Which of the following best describes the difference between static and kinetic friction?<br/>A. Static friction always equals the maximum possible frictional force.<br/>B. Kinetic friction varies with the magnitude of the applied force.<br/>C. Static friction can adjust to match the applied force up to a maximum value, while kinetic friction remains constant once motion begins.<br/>D. Kinetic friction is always greater than static friction.<br/>Answer: C. Static friction can adjust to match the applied force up to a maximum value, while kinetic friction remains constant once motion begins.<br/>Explanation: Static friction resists initial motion by matching the applied force up to a threshold; kinetic friction acts with a constant magnitude once motion has started.<br/><br/>21b. A student pushes a box, increasing the applied force until the box just begins to move. Which statement correctly describes the frictional forces before and after motion begins?<br/>A. Kinetic friction increases as the box speeds up.<br/>B. Static friction decreases as the applied force increases.<br/>C. Static friction matches the applied force until motion starts, then kinetic friction acts at a constant value.<br/>D. Kinetic friction varies depending on how hard the box is pushed.<br/>Answer: C. Static friction matches the applied force until motion starts, then kinetic friction acts at a constant value.<br/>Explanation: Before motion, static friction balances the applied force up to its maximum; after motion begins, kinetic friction is constant regardless of the applied force.<br/><br/>21c. Which scenario demonstrates the unique property of kinetic friction compared to static friction?<br/>A. A stationary book resists sliding as you gradually increase your push.<br/>B. A sled moves at a constant speed across ice despite increasing force.<br/>C. A block remains at rest because friction cannot match the applied force.<br/>D. A car tire spins on ice without moving forward.<br/>Answer: B. A sled moves at a constant speed across ice despite increasing force.<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction remains constant regardless of increasing applied force, unlike static friction, which varies up to its maximum; thus, the sled’s constant-speed motion despite varying push illustrates this property. | - | - |
| 22 | The coefficient of friction depends on the two materials in contact. The coefficient of static friction is always higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. | 22a. Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the coefficient of static friction and the coefficient of kinetic friction for a given pair of materials?<br/>A. The coefficient of static friction is always less than the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>B. The coefficient of static friction is always equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>C. The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>D. The coefficients of friction are unrelated to each other.<br/>Answer: C. The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>Explanation: For any two materials in contact, the coefficient of static friction exceeds that of kinetic friction, reflecting the greater force required to initiate motion compared to maintaining it.<br/><br/>22b. A block rests on a wooden table. Which change would most likely increase the coefficient of friction between the block and the table?<br/>A. Replacing the wooden block with a rubber block<br/>B. Increasing the mass of the block<br/>C. Increasing the surface area of contact<br/>D. Pushing the block faster across the table<br/>Answer: A. Replacing the wooden block with a rubber block<br/>Explanation: The coefficient of friction depends on the nature of the materials in contact; rubber generally has a higher coefficient of friction with wood than wood does with wood.<br/><br/>22c. Why is it generally more difficult to initiate the motion of a stationary object than to keep it moving at constant speed?<br/>A. Because kinetic friction is always greater than static friction<br/>B. Because static friction is always greater than kinetic friction<br/>C. Because friction does not depend on the materials in contact<br/>D. Because friction increases with speed<br/>Answer: B. Because static friction is always greater than kinetic friction<br/>Explanation: The maximum static frictional force exceeds the kinetic frictional force, so more force is required to overcome static friction and start motion than to maintain motion. | - | - |

Mass is a measure of inertia, while weight is a measure of gravitational force.<br/>B. Mass changes depending on location, while weight remains constant.<br/>C. Mass is measured in newtons, while weight is measured in kilograms.<br/>D. Mass and weight are both scalar quantities.<br/>Answer: A. Mass is a measure of inertia, while weight is a measure of gravitational force.<br/>Explanation: Mass is an intrinsic property of matter reflecting its resistance to acceleration (inertia), whereas weight is the force exerted on that mass by gravity.<br/><br/>23b. An astronaut travels from Earth to the Moon. Which of the following statements is true regarding the astronaut’s mass and weight?<br/>A. Both mass and weight decrease.<br/>B. Mass decreases, but weight remains the same.<br/>C. Mass remains the same, but weight decreases.<br/>D. Both mass and weight remain the same.<br/>Answer: C. Mass remains the same, but weight decreases.<br/>Explanation: Mass is invariant regardless of location, but weight decreases on the Moon due to its lower gravitational acceleration.<br/><br/>23c. A student claims that a 5-kg object on Earth has a weight of 5 kg. What is incorrect about this statement?<br/>A. The object’s mass is not 5 kg.<br/>B. The object’s weight should be expressed in newtons, not kilograms.<br/>C. The object’s mass and weight are always numerically equal.<br/>D. The object has zero weight in all locations.<br/>Answer: B. The object’s weight should be expressed in newtons, not kilograms.<br/>Explanation: Mass is measured in kilograms, but weight is a force and should be expressed in newtons; confusing the units conflates the two concepts. | - | - |
| 24 | Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object-its amount of material. | 24a. Which of the following best describes the physical property measured by mass?<br/>A. The amount of space an object occupies<br/>B. The resistance of an object to changes in its motion<br/>C. The energy an object possesses due to its position<br/>D. The force an object exerts due to gravity<br/>Answer: B. The resistance of an object to changes in its motion<br/>Explanation: Mass quantifies an object's inertia, which is its resistance to acceleration when a force is applied.<br/><br/>24b. If two objects have the same volume but different masses, what can be inferred about their inertial properties?<br/>A. They have the same inertia because their volumes are equal<br/>B. The object with greater mass has more inertia<br/>C. The object with smaller mass has more inertia<br/>D. Both have equal inertia if their shapes are identical<br/>Answer: B. The object with greater mass has more inertia<br/>Explanation: Inertia depends solely on mass, not volume or shape; greater mass means greater resistance to changes in motion.<br/><br/>24c. Which statement correctly distinguishes mass from weight in terms of physical meaning?<br/>A. Mass is dependent on gravity, while weight is not<br/>B. Mass measures inertia, while weight measures gravitational force<br/>C. Mass changes with location, but weight does not<br/>D. Mass and weight are identical physical quantities<br/>Answer: B. Mass measures inertia, while weight measures gravitational force<br/>Explanation: Mass is a measure of the amount of matter and inertia, whereas weight is the force due to gravity acting on that mass. | 24a. A spacecraft far from any gravitational sources fires its engines to increase its velocity. Which of the following properties of the spacecraft most directly relates to the difficulty in changing its velocity?<br/>A. Volume<br/>B. Mass<br/>C. Weight<br/>D. Surface Area<br/>Answer: B. Mass<br/>Explanation: Inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its state of motion. Mass is a direct measure of an object's inertia; greater mass means greater resistance to acceleration.<br/><br/>24b. Two objects, one with a larger mass and one with a smaller mass, are subjected to the same net force. Which statement best describes their resulting accelerations?<br/>A. Both objects will experience the same acceleration.<br/>B. The object with the larger mass will experience a smaller acceleration.<br/>C. The object with the smaller mass will experience a smaller acceleration.<br/>D. The object with the larger mass will experience a larger acceleration.<br/>Answer: B. The object with the larger mass will experience a smaller acceleration.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law (F = ma) shows that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass when force is constant. Higher mass leads to less acceleration for the same applied force, demonstrating inertia.<br/><br/>24c. An astronaut in the International Space Station experiences apparent weightlessness. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the astronaut's mass?<br/>A. The astronaut's mass is zero because they are weightless.<br/>B. The astronaut's mass is significantly reduced but not zero.<br/>C. The astronaut's mass is the same as it would be on Earth.<br/>D. The astronaut's mass is immeasurable in a weightless environment.<br/>Answer: C. The astronaut's mass is the same as it would be on Earth.<br/>Explanation: Mass is an intrinsic property representing the amount of matter, independent of gravitational force or weight.

Which scenario correctly illustrates the difference between mass and weight?<br/>A. A 5 kg rock has the same weight on Earth and Mars<br/>B. A 5 kg rock has the same mass on Earth and Mars, but different weights<br/>C. A 5 kg rock has different masses on Earth and Mars, but the same weight<br/>D. A 5 kg rock's mass and weight both change when moved from Earth to Mars<br/>Answer: B. A 5 kg rock has the same mass on Earth and Mars, but different weights<br/>Explanation: Mass remains constant regardless of location, but weight varies because it depends on the local gravitational acceleration. | 25a. Which of the following scenarios would result in the greatest decrease in an object's weight?<br/>A. Moving the object from sea level to a mountaintop.<br/>B. Submerging the object completely in water.<br/>C. Placing the object in a freely falling elevator.<br/>D. Charging the object with a large positive electrostatic charge.<br/>Answer: C. Placing the object in a freely falling elevator.<br/>Explanation: Weight is the force of gravity on an object. In a freely falling elevator, the object experiences apparent weightlessness because the gravitational force is the only force acting on it in the non-inertial reference frame. The other options affect either the gravitational force minutely or introduce other forces besides gravity.<br/><br/>25b. An astronaut is orbiting the Earth in the space station. Which of the following statements best describes the astronaut's weight?<br/>A.

The astronaut's weight is nearly equal to their weight on Earth.<br/>D. The astronaut's weight is dependent on the speed of the space station.<br/>Answer: A. The astronaut's weight is equal to their mass multiplied by the Earth's gravitational acceleration at that altitude.<br/>Explanation: Weight is the force due to gravity. Even in orbit, the astronaut experiences Earth's gravitational pull. Weight is still defined as mg, where g is the local gravitational acceleration, even in orbit. The astronaut experiences weightlessness because the space station is in freefall.<br/><br/>25c. Which of the following forces directly contributes to the measured weight of an object resting on a bathroom scale at sea level?<br/>A. The buoyant force exerted by the atmosphere.<br/>B. The electromagnetic force between the scale and the object.<br/>C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the object.<br/>D. The normal force exerted by the scale on the object.<br/>Answer: C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the object.<br/>Explanation: Weight is defined as the force of gravity on an object. The scale measures the force the object exerts due to gravity, which is then interpreted as the object's weight. The normal force is equal and opposite to the object's apparent weight (accounting for buoyancy if it were present). | - |
| 26 | Acceleration is the vector representation of the change in velocity over time. Average or instantaneous acceleration may both be considered, similar to velocity. | 26a. Which of the following best describes acceleration in the context of kinematics?<br/>A. The rate at which an object's position changes with respect to time<br/>B. The vector representation of the change in velocity over time<br/>C. The total distance traveled divided by the total time taken<br/>D. The scalar quantity representing how fast an object is moving<br/>Answer: B. The vector representation of the change in velocity over time<br/>Explanation: Acceleration is specifically defined as the vector quantity that describes how velocity changes with time, distinguishing it from position and speed.<br/><br/>26b. In which scenario is an object experiencing acceleration, even if its speed remains constant?<br/>A. A car traveling in a straight line at a constant speed<br/>B. A runner slowing down to stop<br/>C. A satellite moving at constant speed in a circular orbit<br/>D. A ball at rest on the ground<br/>Answer: C. A satellite moving at constant speed in a circular orbit<br/>Explanation: Acceleration involves any change in velocity, including changes in direction; thus, uniform circular motion involves acceleration even at constant speed.<br/><br/>26c. Which statement accurately distinguishes between average and instantaneous acceleration?<br/>A. Average acceleration is always equal to instantaneous acceleration<br/>B. Instantaneous acceleration considers the change in velocity over an extended time interval<br/>C. Average acceleration refers to the change in velocity over a specific time period, while instantaneous acceleration refers to the change at a particular moment<br/>D. Both average and instantaneous acceleration ignore the direction of velocity<br/>Answer: C. Average acceleration refers to the change in velocity over a specific time period, while instantaneous acceleration refers to the change at a particular moment<br/>Explanation: Average acceleration is measured over a finite interval, while instantaneous acceleration is the value at a specific instant, reflecting the difference in how they capture changes in velocity. | 26a. A race car accelerates from rest to 100 m/s in 4 seconds. Which of the following statements best describes the car's acceleration?<br/>A. The car experienced a constant velocity during the 4 seconds.<br/>B. The car experienced a change in velocity during the 4 seconds.<br/>C. The car's displacement remained constant during the 4 seconds.<br/>D. The car's kinetic energy remained constant during the 4 seconds.<br/>Answer: B. The car experienced a change in velocity during the 4 seconds.<br/>Explanation: Acceleration, by definition, is the change in velocity over time. Since the car's velocity increased, it experienced acceleration.<br/><br/>26b. A projectile is launched horizontally from a cliff. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following quantities remains constant during the projectile's flight?<br/>A. Vertical component of velocity<br/>B. Horizontal component of velocity<br/>C. Magnitude of the net force acting on the projectile<br/>D. Magnitude of the acceleration vector of the projectile<br/>Answer: D. Magnitude of the acceleration vector of the projectile<br/>Explanation: Since only gravity acts on the projectile, the acceleration is constant and equal to 'g' downwards, which is the acceleration due to gravity. The horizontal velocity is constant, but the question asked specifically about acceleration. The net force also remains constant.<br/><br/>26c. Which of the following scenarios demonstrates an object experiencing zero acceleration?<br/>A. A car traveling around a circular track at a constant speed.<br/>B. A pendulum swinging back and forth.<br/>C. A skydiver falling at terminal velocity.<br/>D. A ball thrown upwards that is momentarily at rest at its peak height.<br/>Answer: C. A skydiver falling at terminal velocity.<br/>Explanation: Terminal velocity indicates constant velocity, which implies zero acceleration. Circular motion always has centripetal acceleration, and the pendulum and the ball are both changing velocity. | - |
| 27 | Newton's first law, or the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or move with a constant velocity if there is no net force on the object. | 27a. Which of the following best describes the principle stated by Newton's first law of motion?<br/>A. An object will accelerate unless acted upon by a net force.<br/>B. An object will remain at rest or move at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.<br/>C. An object will always move in a straight line regardless of forces.<br/>D. An object will decrease its velocity unless a force maintains it.<br/>Answer: B. An object will remain at rest or move at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's first law states that in the absence of a net force, an object's state of motion will not change; it will either remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity.<br/><br/>27b. A hockey puck slides across perfectly smooth, frictionless ice. According to Newton's first law, what will happen to the puck if no external forces act on it?<br/>A. It will gradually slow down and stop.<br/>B. It will continue moving at a constant speed in a straight line.<br/>C. It will curve due to its inertia.<br/>D. It will accelerate in the direction of motion.<br/>Answer: B. It will continue moving at a constant speed in a straight line.<br/>Explanation: Without external forces such as friction, Newton's first law predicts the puck will maintain its velocity (both speed and direction), illustrating inertia.<br/><br/>27c. Which scenario demonstrates a violation of Newton's first law?<br/>A. A stationary box remains at rest on a frictionless surface.<br/>B. A car moving at constant velocity suddenly slows down without any apparent force.<br/>C. A satellite orbits Earth at constant speed in a circular path.<br/>D. A dropped ball accelerates downward due to gravity.<br/>Answer: B. A car moving at constant velocity suddenly slows down without any apparent force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's first law requires a net force for a change in velocity; a car slowing down without any force contradicts the law, as velocity changes only in response to net forces. | 27a. A spaceship is drifting in deep space with its engines off. Which of the following best describes the motion of the spaceship?<br/>A. It will eventually slow down and stop due to the lack of propulsion.<br/>B. It will continue to move at a constant velocity indefinitely unless acted upon by a net external force.<br/>C. It will accelerate due to the absence of friction.<br/>D. It will randomly change its direction of motion.<br/>Answer: B. It will continue to move at a constant velocity indefinitely unless acted upon by a net external force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's first law states that an object in motion will stay in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force. Deep space has negligible external forces, so the spaceship's velocity will remain constant.<br/><br/>27b. Which of the following situations best exemplifies the principle of inertia?<br/>A. A car accelerating from rest.<br/>B. A ball rolling on a flat, level surface maintaining a constant speed.<br/>C. A skydiver experiencing air resistance.<br/>D. A rocket launching into space with constant thrust.<br/>Answer: B. A ball rolling on a flat, level surface maintaining a constant speed.<br/>Explanation: Inertia describes an object's tendency to resist changes in its state of motion. A ball rolling at a constant speed on a level surface is an example of inertia since it maintains a constant velocity when no net force acts upon it.<br/><br/>27c. Which of the following is the MOST fundamental consequence of Newton's First Law?<br/>A. Objects require a force to maintain a constant velocity.<br/>B. Acceleration is always proportional to an applied force.<br/>C. A net force is required to change an object's state of motion.<br/>D. Gravity is a force that acts on all objects with mass.<br/>Answer: C. A net force is required to change an object's state of motion.<br/>Explanation: Newton's First Law essentially says that without a net force, an object will maintain its current state of motion, whether at rest or moving at a constant velocity. Therefore, a force is fundamentally required to *change* that state of motion. | - |
| 28 | Newton's second law states that any acceleration is the result of the sum of the forces acting on the object and its mass. | 28a. Which of the following best describes the relationship expressed by Newton's second law of motion?<br/>A. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the sum of the forces acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>B. The net force on an object is always equal to its velocity times its mass.<br/>C. The acceleration of an object is always in the opposite direction of the net force.<br/>D. The sum of the forces on an object is always zero if the object is moving.<br/>Answer: A. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the sum of the forces acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law states that net force equals mass times acceleration, indicating acceleration depends on both net force and mass.<br/><br/>28b. A student observes an object at rest that suddenly begins to accelerate. According to Newton's second law, which of the following must have occurred?<br/>A. The mass of the object decreased.<br/>B. A net external force began acting on the object.<br/>C. The object's inertia changed spontaneously.<br/>D. The object’s velocity became constant.<br/>Answer: B. A net external force began acting on the object.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law requires a net force to cause acceleration; acceleration cannot occur without a net external force.<br/><br/>28c. Which scenario violates Newton's second law as stated in classical mechanics?<br/>A. A car maintains constant velocity while the net force on it is zero.<br/>B. An object accelerates in the absence of any net external force.<br/>C. A ball at rest remains at rest when no forces act on it.<br/>D. A block slows down due to friction acting opposite its motion.<br/>Answer: B. An object accelerates in the absence of any net external force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law dictates that acceleration only results from a net force; acceleration without a net force is not possible. | 28a. Question text<br/>Which of the following statements best encapsulates Newton's second law?<br/>A. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net external force.<br/>B. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>C.

Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed.<br/>Answer: C. The net force acting on an object is directly proportional to the object's acceleration and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>Explanation: Newton's Second Law directly relates net force, mass, and acceleration. The relationship shows that a greater force or a smaller mass will result in greater acceleration. Choices A, B, and D describe Newton's First Law, Newton's Third Law, and the Law of Conservation of Energy, respectively.<br/><br/>28b. Question text<br/>A block of mass *m* slides across a frictionless horizontal surface with constant velocity.

The net force is directed opposite to the direction of motion.<br/>C. The net force is zero.<br/>D. The net force is increasing over time.<br/>Answer: C. The net force is zero.<br/>Explanation: Newton's Second Law states that acceleration is proportional to net force. Since the velocity is constant, acceleration is zero, and therefore the net force must also be zero, regardless of any individual forces that may be present.<br/><br/>28c. Question text<br/>Two objects, one with mass *m* and another with mass 2*m*, are subjected to the same net force. How do their accelerations compare?<br/>A. The object with mass *m* experiences twice the acceleration of the object with mass 2*m*.<br/>B. The object with mass 2*m* experiences twice the acceleration of the object with mass *m*.<br/>C. Both objects experience the same acceleration.<br/>D. The object with mass *m* experiences four times the acceleration of the object with mass 2*m*.<br/>Answer: A. The object with mass *m* experiences twice the acceleration of the object with mass 2*m*.<br/>Explanation: According to Newton's second law, *a* = *F*/ *m*. If the net force, *F*, is the same for both objects, the object with half the mass will have twice the acceleration. | - |

An object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force.<br/>C. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>D. The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.<br/>Answer: C. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law states that forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs between interacting objects.<br/><br/>29b. When a bat strikes a baseball, which statement correctly applies Newton's third law?<br/>A. The bat exerts a greater force on the ball than the ball exerts on the bat.<br/>B. The ball exerts a greater force on the bat than the bat exerts on the ball.<br/>C. The bat and the ball exert equal and opposite forces on each other.<br/>D. Only the bat exerts a force during the collision.<br/>Answer: C. The bat and the ball exert equal and opposite forces on each other.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law requires that the force the bat exerts on the ball is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the ball exerts on the bat.<br/><br/>29c. Which scenario does NOT illustrate Newton’s third law?<br/>A. A swimmer pushes water backward and moves forward.<br/>B. A rocket expels exhaust gases downward and lifts off upward.<br/>C. A car accelerates due to friction between its tires and the road.<br/>D. A ball rolling on a flat surface eventually comes to rest due to friction.<br/>Answer: D. A ball rolling on a flat surface eventually comes to rest due to friction.<br/>Explanation: Option D describes a process involving friction and energy dissipation, not a pair of equal and opposite interaction forces as specified by Newton’s third law. | 29a. Question text<br/>A satellite orbits the Earth. Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth?<br/>A. The Earth exerts a significantly greater gravitational force on the satellite.<br/>B. The satellite exerts a significantly greater gravitational force on the Earth.<br/>C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth are equal in magnitude.<br/>D. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth depend on the satellite's velocity.<br/>Answer: C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth are equal in magnitude.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law dictates that interacting objects exert equal and opposite forces on each other, regardless of mass differences. The gravitational force constitutes such an interaction, hence the forces are equal.<br/><br/>29b. Question text<br/>A car accelerates forward. What is the "reaction" force, as described by Newton's third law, to the force exerted by the tires on the road?<br/>A. The force exerted by the air resistance on the car.<br/>B. The force exerted by the car's engine to turn the tires.<br/>C. The force exerted by the road on the tires.<br/>D. The force exerted by the tires on the car.<br/>Answer: C. The force exerted by the road on the tires.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the tires push backward on the road (action), the road pushes forward on the tires (reaction), enabling the car's acceleration.<br/><br/>29c. Question text<br/>A person leans against a wall. Which of the following force pairs illustrates Newton's third law?<br/>A. The person's weight and the normal force from the ground.<br/>B. The force of the person on the wall and the force of the wall on the person.<br/>C. The person's weight and the upward force exerted by the person’s muscles.<br/>D. The force of friction between the person's shoes and the ground and the force of the wall on the person.<br/>Answer: B. The force of the person on the wall and the force of the wall on the person.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law focuses on interacting pairs. The person applies a force *on the wall*, and the wall correspondingly applies an equal and opposite force *on the person*. | - |
| 30 | Linear motion includes free fall and motion in which the velocity and acceleration vectors are parallel or antiparallel. | 30a. Which of the following scenarios best exemplifies linear motion as defined in kinematics?<br/>A. A car moving in a circular track at constant speed<br/>B. A stone dropped from a bridge into a river below<br/>C. A spinning ice skater pulling in her arms<br/>D. An electron moving in a magnetic field along a curved path<br/>Answer: B. A stone dropped from a bridge into a river below<br/>Explanation: Linear motion refers to motion along a straight line, including free fall, where velocity and acceleration are parallel or antiparallel.<br/><br/>30b. In linear motion, what is the relationship between the velocity and acceleration vectors?<br/>A. They are always perpendicular<br/>B. They are either parallel or antiparallel<br/>C. They are always in the same direction<br/>D. They are always in opposite directions<br/>Answer: B. They are either parallel or antiparallel<br/>Explanation: In linear motion, velocity and acceleration vectors are aligned along the same straight line, either in the same (parallel) or opposite (antiparallel) directions.<br/><br/>30c. Which of the following motions does NOT qualify as linear motion?<br/>A. A ball thrown vertically upward<br/>B. A block sliding down a frictionless incline in a straight path<br/>C. A satellite orbiting Earth in a circular path<br/>D. An elevator moving upward at constant acceleration<br/>Answer: C. A satellite orbiting Earth in a circular path<br/>Explanation: Linear motion requires movement along a straight line, whereas a satellite in orbit follows a curved (circular) path, so it is not linear motion. | 30a. A skydiver jumps from a plane. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following statements best describes the skydiver's acceleration immediately after jumping?<br/>A. The acceleration is constant and equal to zero.<br/>B. The acceleration is decreasing as the skydiver falls.<br/>C. The acceleration is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity.<br/>D. The acceleration is increasing as the skydiver falls.<br/>Answer: C. The acceleration is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity.<br/>Explanation: In free fall, the only force acting on the object (neglecting air resistance) is gravity, resulting in a constant downward acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s². This is independent of the object's velocity.<br/><br/>30b. Under what condition is the average velocity of an object undergoing linear motion equal to the average of its initial and final velocities?<br/>A. When the object is accelerating.<br/>B. When the object's acceleration is constant.<br/>C. When the object's displacement is zero.<br/>D. When the object is moving at a constant velocity.<br/>Answer: B. When the object's acceleration is constant.<br/>Explanation: The average velocity is equal to (vi + vf)/2 only when the acceleration is constant. This is a direct result of the kinematic equations derived under constant acceleration.<br/><br/>30c. A car travels along a straight road. Which of the following scenarios describes a situation where the car's velocity and acceleration vectors are antiparallel?<br/>A. The car is speeding up while moving forward.<br/>B. The car is slowing down while moving forward.<br/>C. The car is moving at a constant velocity.<br/>D. The car is stopped at a red light.<br/>Answer: B. The car is slowing down while moving forward.<br/>Explanation: Antiparallel vectors point in opposite directions. If the car is moving forward (positive velocity) and slowing down, the acceleration must be in the opposite direction (negative) to decrease the velocity, indicating antiparallel vectors. | - |
| 31 | Projectile motion contains both an x- and y-component. Assuming negligible air resistance, the only force acting on the object is gravity. | 31a. Which of the following best describes the forces acting on a projectile in motion, assuming air resistance is negligible?<br/>A. Both gravity and a forward force act on the projectile<br/>B. Only gravity acts on the projectile<br/>C. Gravity and a constant upward force act on the projectile<br/>D. Gravity and friction act on the projectile<br/>Answer: B. Only gravity acts on the projectile<br/>Explanation: In ideal projectile motion, the only force acting on the object after launch is gravity, which acts downward; there is no forward or frictional force when air resistance is neglected.<br/><br/>31b. During projectile motion, which component of velocity remains constant if air resistance is negligible?<br/>A. The vertical (y) component<br/>B. Both the vertical (y) and horizontal (x) components<br/>C. The horizontal (x) component<br/>D. Neither component<br/>Answer: C. The horizontal (x) component<br/>Explanation: Without air resistance, gravity only affects the vertical component of velocity; the horizontal component remains constant throughout the motion.<br/><br/>31c. A student claims that a projectile slows down in the horizontal direction due to gravity. What is the correct evaluation of this statement?<br/>A. Correct, gravity slows horizontal motion<br/>B. Incorrect, gravity only affects vertical motion<br/>C. Correct, gravity affects both vertical and horizontal motion equally<br/>D. Incorrect, gravity has no effect on projectile motion<br/>Answer: B. Incorrect, gravity only affects vertical motion<br/>Explanation: Gravity acts downward, affecting only the vertical (y) component of motion; it does not influence the horizontal (x) component in the absence of air resistance. | 31a. A projectile is launched horizontally. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following statements best describes the projectile's motion?<br/>A. The horizontal velocity is constant, and the vertical velocity increases linearly.<br/>B. The horizontal velocity increases linearly, and the vertical velocity is constant.<br/>C. Both the horizontal and vertical velocities increase linearly.<br/>D. Both the horizontal and vertical velocities are constant.<br/>Answer: A. The horizontal velocity is constant, and the vertical velocity increases linearly.<br/>Explanation: In projectile motion without air resistance, the horizontal velocity remains constant due to inertia. The vertical velocity increases linearly due to the constant acceleration of gravity.<br/><br/>31b. Two projectiles are launched with the same initial speed but at different angles. Projectile A is launched at 30° above the horizontal, and projectile B is launched at 60° above the horizontal. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following is true?<br/>A. Projectile A experiences a greater horizontal acceleration than Projectile B.<br/>B. Projectile B experiences a greater horizontal acceleration than Projectile A.<br/>C. Both projectiles experience the same non-zero horizontal acceleration.<br/>D. Both projectiles experience zero horizontal acceleration.<br/>Answer: D. Both projectiles experience zero horizontal acceleration.<br/>Explanation: In projectile motion, the only force acting on the object is gravity, which acts vertically. Therefore, the horizontal acceleration is zero for both projectiles, regardless of their launch angle.<br/><br/>31c. A cannon fires a projectile. If air resistance is negligible, what happens to the projectile's vertical acceleration during its flight?<br/>A. It increases continuously.<br/>B. It decreases continuously.<br/>C. It remains constant.<br/>D. It is zero at the peak of the trajectory.<br/>Answer: C. It remains constant.<br/>Explanation: Neglecting air resistance, the only force acting on the projectile is gravity, which results in a constant downward acceleration. The vertical acceleration remains constant throughout the projectile's entire trajectory. | - |
| 32 | Inclined planes are another example of two-dimensional movement. It is often easiest to consider the dimensions as being parallel and perpendicular to the surface of the plane. | 32a. When analyzing motion on an inclined plane, why is it advantageous to resolve forces into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface?<br/>A. It simplifies calculations by aligning with the directions of acceleration and normal force.<br/>B. It eliminates the need to consider gravitational force.<br/>C. It allows friction to be ignored in all cases.<br/>D. It is only necessary for horizontal surfaces.<br/>Answer: A. It simplifies calculations by aligning with the directions of acceleration and normal force.<br/>Explanation: Resolving forces parallel and perpendicular to the inclined surface aligns with the directions of key forces (gravity, normal force, friction), simplifying analysis—an essential technique for MCAT physics problems.<br/><br/>32b. Which of the following best describes the two-dimensional nature of motion on an inclined plane?<br/>A. Motion occurs only vertically.<br/>B. Motion can be described using components along and perpendicular to the plane's surface.<br/>C. Motion is always circular.<br/>D. Motion is unaffected by gravity.<br/>Answer: B. Motion can be described using components along and perpendicular to the plane's surface.<br/>Explanation: On an inclined plane, movement and forces are best described in two dimensions: parallel and perpendicular to the surface, reflecting the plane's geometry and the direction of forces.<br/><br/>32c. A student claims that analyzing forces on an inclined plane is identical to analyzing forces on a flat (horizontal) surface. Which statement best refutes this claim?<br/>A. The normal force on an incline always equals the object's weight.<br/>B. Gravity acts only perpendicular to the surface on an incline.<br/>C. On an incline, gravitational force must be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.<br/>D. Friction does not exist on inclined planes.<br/>Answer: C. On an incline, gravitational force must be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.<br/>Explanation: Unlike flat surfaces, inclined planes require resolving gravity into two components due to the angle, which affects both the normal force and the object's acceleration down the plane. | 32a. A block slides down a frictionless inclined plane. If the angle of the incline with respect to the horizontal is increased, what happens to the component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the plane?<br/>A. It decreases.<br/>B. It increases.<br/>C. It remains the same.<br/>D. It becomes zero.<br/>Answer: B. It increases.<br/>Explanation: The component of gravitational force parallel to the inclined plane is *mg*sinθ. As θ increases, sinθ also increases, resulting in a larger parallel component of the gravitational force.<br/><br/>32b. A box is at rest on an inclined plane. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the static frictional force acting on the box?<br/>A. It is equal to the weight of the box.<br/>B. It is equal to the component of the weight of the box perpendicular to the plane.<br/>C. It is equal to the component of the weight of the box parallel to the plane.<br/>D. It is zero since the box is not moving.<br/>Answer: C. It is equal to the component of the weight of the box parallel to the plane.<br/>Explanation: Since the box is stationary, the static frictional force must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the inclined plane, ensuring the net force is zero.<br/><br/>32c. A crate is being pushed up an inclined plane at a constant velocity. If the plane were perfectly horizontal instead, and the crate was pushed across it at the same constant velocity, which of the following must be true?<br/>A. The required pushing force would be less.<br/>B. The required pushing force would be greater.<br/>C. The required pushing force would be the same.<br/>D. The relationship between the required pushing forces cannot be determined without knowing the coefficient of friction.<br/>Answer: A. The required pushing force would be less.<br/>Explanation: On an inclined plane, the pushing force must overcome both friction and the component of gravity parallel to the plane. On a horizontal surface, it only needs to overcome friction (which may be reduced due to a lower normal force). | - |
| 33 | Circular motion is best thought of as having radial and tangential dimensions. In uniform circular motion, the only force is the centripetal force, pointing radially inward. The instantaneous velocity vector always points tangentially. | 33a. Which of the following best describes the direction of the instantaneous velocity vector for an object undergoing uniform circular motion?<br/>A. Radially inward toward the center of the circle<br/>B. Radially outward from the center of the circle<br/>C. Tangential to the path at every point<br/>D. Perpendicular to the plane of the circle<br/>Answer: C. Tangential to the path at every point<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, the instantaneous velocity vector is always tangent to the circle at the object's position, reflecting the direction of motion.<br/><br/>33b. During uniform circular motion, which force is responsible for maintaining the object's path, and in which direction does it act?<br/>A. Centripetal force, acting radially inward<br/>B. Centrifugal force, acting radially outward<br/>C. Gravitational force, acting tangentially<br/>D. Normal force, acting perpendicular to the motion<br/>Answer: A. Centripetal force, acting radially inward<br/>Explanation: The centripetal force is the net force that always points toward the center of the circle, keeping the object in its circular path.<br/><br/>33c. A student claims that in uniform circular motion, there must be a tangential force to maintain constant speed. Which of the following best evaluates this claim?<br/>A. Correct, because tangential force is needed to keep the object moving<br/>B. Incorrect, because only a radial (centripetal) force is needed for constant speed<br/>C. Correct, because tangential force balances the centripetal force<br/>D. Incorrect, because no forces are required in circular motion<br/>Answer: B. Incorrect, because only a radial (centripetal) force is needed for constant speed<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, speed is constant, so only a centripetal (radial) force is required; a tangential force would change the speed. | 33a. Question text<br/>An object is moving in uniform circular motion. Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between the net force acting on the object and its instantaneous velocity?<br/>A. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always parallel.<br/>B. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always anti-parallel.<br/>C. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always perpendicular.<br/>D. The net force and instantaneous velocity have a constant, non-zero angle between them.<br/>Answer: C. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always perpendicular.<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, the net force (centripetal force) points radially inward, while the instantaneous velocity points tangentially. These directions are always perpendicular.<br/><br/>33b. Question text<br/>A car is traveling around a circular track at a constant speed. If the track were suddenly covered in ice, eliminating all radial friction, which of the following best describes the car's subsequent motion?<br/>A. The car will continue to move in a circle with a decreasing radius.<br/>B. The car will continue to move in a circle with an increasing radius.<br/>C. The car will move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point where the ice began.<br/>D. The car will immediately come to a complete stop.<br/>Answer: C. The car will move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point where the ice began.<br/>Explanation: Without the centripetal force provided by friction, the car will obey Newton's first law and continue in a straight line along its instantaneous velocity vector, which is tangent to the circle.<br/><br/>33c. Question text<br/>Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of uniform circular motion?<br/>A. Constant tangential speed.<br/>B. Constant radial acceleration.<br/>C. Constant kinetic energy.<br/>D. Constant radial velocity.<br/>Answer: D. Constant radial velocity.<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, there is no movement in or out of the circle. This means that there cannot be a radial velocity, only a radial acceleration because the direction is changing. | - |
| 34 | Free body diagrams are representations of the forces acting on an object. They are useful for equilibrium and dynamics problems. | 34a. Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of a free body diagram in physics?<br/>A. To illustrate the motion path of an object over time<br/>B. To represent all the forces acting on a single object<br/>C. To calculate the mass of an object<br/>D. To show the velocity vectors of an object<br/>Answer: B. To represent all the forces acting on a single object<br/>Explanation: A free body diagram visually displays all external forces acting on a specific object, which is essential for analyzing equilibrium and dynamics.<br/><br/>34b. When constructing a free body diagram for an object on an inclined plane, which of the following forces should NOT be included?<br/>A. Gravitational force acting on the object<br/>B. Normal force from the surface<br/>C. The object's acceleration vector<br/>D. Frictional force between the object and the plane<br/>Answer: C. The object's acceleration vector<br/>Explanation: Free body diagrams include only forces acting on the object, not its acceleration or velocity vectors.<br/><br/>34c. Why are free body diagrams particularly useful when analyzing objects in equilibrium?<br/>A. They show the net force is always nonzero<br/>B. They help visualize and ensure that the sum of forces equals zero<br/>C. They eliminate the need to consider external forces<br/>D. They provide a direct measurement of force magnitudes<br/>Answer: B. They help visualize and ensure that the sum of forces equals zero<br/>Explanation: For equilibrium, the net force on an object must be zero; free body diagrams help identify and balance all forces to confirm this condition. | 34a. A student is analyzing the motion of a box sliding down an inclined plane. Which of the following forces must be represented in a free body diagram of the box?<br/>A. The force the box exerts on the inclined plane.<br/>B. The net force acting on the box.<br/>C. The gravitational force exerted on the box by the Earth.<br/>D. The force exerted by the box's motion.<br/>Answer: C. The gravitational force exerted on the box by the Earth.<br/>Explanation: A free body diagram represents forces acting *on* the object, not forces exerted *by* the object (Newton's third law). The net force is a result of forces, not a force itself. Fictitious forces (box's motion) are not included.<br/><br/>34b. Two blocks are connected by a rope over a pulley. A student wants to determine if the system is in translational equilibrium. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate use of free body diagrams in this scenario?<br/>A. To visually represent only the internal forces within the system.<br/>B. To visually represent all forces acting on each block to determine if the net force on each block is zero.<br/>C. To visually represent only the forces acting on the pulley.<br/>D. To calculate the acceleration of the system, regardless of equilibrium.<br/>Answer: B. To visually represent all forces acting on each block to determine if the net force on each block is zero.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium requires the net force on *each* object to be zero. Free body diagrams are crucial for visualizing all external forces acting on each block. While internal forces are present, considering external forces on each object is critical for equilibrium.<br/><br/>34c. A physicist is evaluating the forces acting on a stationary object resting on a table. Which of the following force pairs is LEAST likely to be represented on a free body diagram of the object?<br/>A. Weight and Normal Force<br/>B. Applied Force and Friction Force<br/>C. Tension and Weight<br/>D. Action Force and Reaction Force<br/>Answer: D. Action Force and Reaction Force<br/>Explanation: Free body diagrams only include forces *acting on* the object. While action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, they act on different objects (Newton's 3rd Law). Options A, B, and C all describe force pairs where one or both forces act on the object in question. | - |
| 35 | Translational equilibrium occurs in the absence of any net forces acting on an object. An object in translational equilibrium has a constant velocity, and may or may not also be in rotational equilibrium. | 35a. Which of the following best describes the condition required for an object to be in translational equilibrium?<br/>A. The object must have zero velocity.<br/>B. The net force acting on the object must be zero.<br/>C. The object must be at rest and not rotating.<br/>D. The net torque acting on the object must be zero.<br/>Answer: B. The net force acting on the object must be zero.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium requires that the sum of all forces acting on the object is zero, resulting in constant velocity (which could be zero or nonzero).<br/><br/>35b. An object is sliding across a frictionless surface at a constant velocity. Which of the following statements must be true about the object?<br/>A. It is in translational equilibrium but not necessarily in rotational equilibrium.<br/>B. It is in both translational and rotational equilibrium.<br/>C. It is accelerating due to a net force.<br/>D. It must be rotating to maintain equilibrium.<br/>Answer: A. It is in translational equilibrium but not necessarily in rotational equilibrium.<br/>Explanation: Constant velocity implies no net force (translational equilibrium), but nothing is specified about torques or rotational motion.<br/><br/>35c. Which scenario demonstrates a violation of translational equilibrium?<br/>A. A book resting motionless on a table.<br/>B. A car moving at constant speed in a straight line.<br/>C. A hockey puck slowing down due to friction.<br/>D. A satellite orbiting Earth at constant speed in a circular path.<br/>Answer: C. A hockey puck slowing down due to friction.<br/>Explanation: The puck is decelerating, indicating a net force is present and translational equilibrium is not maintained. | 35a. A stationary box rests on a horizontal surface. Which of the following statements best describes the forces acting on the box?<br/>A. The box experiences a net upward force due to the surface.<br/>B. The box experiences a net downward force due to gravity exceeding the normal force.<br/>C. The box is in translational equilibrium because the net force acting on it is zero.<br/>D. The box is not in translational equilibrium because it is not moving.<br/>Answer: C. The box is in translational equilibrium because the net force acting on it is zero.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium requires the net force to be zero. Since the box is stationary, the gravitational force is balanced by the normal force from the surface, resulting in zero net force and thus translational equilibrium.<br/><br/>35b. A spacecraft is drifting through interstellar space with its engines off at a constant velocity. Which of the following must be true?<br/>A. There are no forces acting on the spacecraft.<br/>B. The spacecraft is in rotational equilibrium but not necessarily translational equilibrium.<br/>C. The net force on the spacecraft is zero, indicating translational equilibrium.<br/>D. The spacecraft's inertia is constantly increasing.<br/>Answer: C. The net force on the spacecraft is zero, indicating translational equilibrium.<br/>Explanation: Constant velocity implies zero acceleration. According to Newton's first law, zero acceleration means the net force acting on the object must be zero, which is the condition for translational equilibrium.<br/><br/>35c. An object experiencing a constant non-zero net torque cannot be in translational equilibrium under which condition?<br/>A. If the object is also experiencing a constant non-zero net force.<br/>B. If the object's center of mass is accelerating.<br/>C. If the object's angular velocity is constant.<br/>D. If the object's moment of inertia is constant.<br/>Answer: A. If the object is also experiencing a constant non-zero net force.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium necessitates a zero net force. Therefore, an object experiencing a non-zero net force cannot be in translational equilibrium, regardless of any torques acting on it. | - |
| 36 | Rotational equilibrium occurs in the absence of any net torques acting on an object. Rotational motion may consider any pivot point, but the center of mass is most common. An object in rotational equilibrium has a constant angular velocity; on the MCAT, the angular velocity is usually zero. | 36a. Which of the following best describes the condition necessary for an object to be in rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. The net force acting on the object must be zero.<br/>B. The net torque acting on the object must be zero.<br/>C. The object must be at rest.<br/>D. The object must be rotating at a constant speed.<br/>Answer: B. The net torque acting on the object must be zero.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium requires that the sum of all torques acting on an object is zero, ensuring no change in angular velocity.<br/><br/>36b. If an object is in rotational equilibrium, which of the following statements must be true regarding its angular velocity?<br/>A. The angular velocity must be increasing.<br/>B. The angular velocity must be zero.<br/>C. The angular velocity must be constant.<br/>D. The angular velocity must be decreasing.<br/>Answer: C. The angular velocity must be constant.<br/>Explanation: In rotational equilibrium, the absence of net torque means angular velocity does not change, though it can be zero or nonzero.<br/><br/>36c. A student claims that an object in rotational equilibrium must always be motionless. Which of the following best addresses this misconception?<br/>A. Rotational equilibrium requires zero linear velocity, not angular velocity.<br/>B. Rotational equilibrium only requires that the object is not accelerating linearly.<br/>C. Rotational equilibrium means the object's angular velocity is constant, which can include being motionless or spinning steadily.<br/>D. Rotational equilibrium means there are no forces acting on the object.<br/>Answer: C. Rotational equilibrium means the object's angular velocity is constant, which can include being motionless or spinning steadily.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium implies constant angular velocity, so the object can be at rest or rotating uniformly; motionlessness is not required. | 36a. An irregularly shaped object is suspended from a string attached to a single point on the object. The object is at rest. Which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the torques acting on the object?<br/>A. The net torque about the point of suspension is non-zero, but the net torque about the center of mass is zero.<br/>B. The net torque about both the point of suspension and the center of mass is zero.<br/>C. The net torque about the point of suspension is zero, but the net torque about the center of mass is non-zero.<br/>D. The net torque about both the point of suspension and the center of mass is non-zero.<br/>Answer: B. The net torque about both the point of suspension and the center of mass is zero.<br/>Explanation: The object is in rotational equilibrium, meaning the net torque about any point is zero, including the suspension point and the center of mass. Any non-zero net torque would result in angular acceleration.<br/><br/>36b. A seesaw with unequal arm lengths is perfectly balanced with a child on each end. Which of the following must be true regarding the torques exerted by the children on the seesaw, taking the fulcrum (pivot point) as the reference?<br/>A. The child on the longer arm exerts a greater torque.<br/>B. The child on the shorter arm exerts a greater torque.<br/>C. The torques exerted by each child are equal in magnitude.<br/>D. The torque exerted by the heavier child is greater.<br/>Answer: C. The torques exerted by each child are equal in magnitude.<br/>Explanation: For the seesaw to be in rotational equilibrium, the net torque must be zero. This implies that the clockwise and counterclockwise torques are equal in magnitude, regardless of the arm lengths or the children's weights.<br/><br/>36c. Which of the following scenarios best exemplifies an object NOT in rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. A ceiling fan rotating at a constant angular velocity.<br/>B. A bicycle wheel spinning freely on an axle with no external forces applied.<br/>C. A door held ajar by a doorstop.<br/>D. A merry-go-round slowing down to a stop.<br/>Answer: D. A merry-go-round slowing down to a stop.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium requires a constant angular velocity (including zero). A merry-go-round slowing down indicates a changing angular velocity and thus a net torque acting on it, meaning it's not in rotational equilibrium. | - |
