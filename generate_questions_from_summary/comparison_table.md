| 2 | Vectors are physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Vector quantities include displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, among others. | 2a. Which of the following physical quantities is a vector?<br/>A. Temperature<br/>B. Speed<br/>C. Acceleration<br/>D. Energy<br/>Answer: C. Acceleration<br/>Explanation: Acceleration is a vector because it has both magnitude and direction, unlike temperature, speed, and energy, which are scalar quantities.<br/><br/>2b. A student walks 5 meters east and then 5 meters north. Which property of vectors allows the student's total displacement to be represented as a single arrow from the starting point to the final position?<br/>A. Vectors can only be added if they are parallel<br/>B. Vectors are added using the head-to-tail method<br/>C. Vectors cannot be combined geometrically<br/>D. Vectors lose their direction upon addition<br/>Answer: B. Vectors are added using the head-to-tail method<br/>Explanation: The head-to-tail method allows vectors to be added graphically, resulting in a single resultant vector that represents the total displacement.<br/><br/>2c. Which of the following best distinguishes a vector quantity from a scalar quantity?<br/>A. Vectors can be negative, scalars cannot<br/>B. Vectors have both magnitude and direction, scalars have only magnitude<br/>C. Vectors are always larger in value than scalars<br/>D. Vectors cannot be measured experimentally<br/>Answer: B. Vectors have both magnitude and direction, scalars have only magnitude<br/>Explanation: The defining feature of a vector is that it possesses both magnitude and direction, whereas scalars have magnitude only. | 2a. Which of the following best describes the defining characteristic that distinguishes a vector quantity from a scalar quantity?<br/>A. A vector quantity is always positive, while a scalar quantity can be negative.<br/>B. A vector quantity requires specification of both magnitude and direction, while a scalar quantity requires only magnitude.<br/>C. A vector quantity is always associated with motion, while a scalar quantity is not.<br/>D. A vector quantity can only describe fundamental properties like mass and time, while a scalar quantity describes derived properties like energy.<br/>Answer: B. A vector quantity requires specification of both magnitude and direction, while a scalar quantity requires only magnitude.<br/>Explanation: The key difference between vectors and scalars is that vectors possess both magnitude AND direction. Scalars are fully defined by their magnitude alone. Understanding this fundamental distinction is crucial for vector analysis.<br/><br/>2b. A student is analyzing the forces acting on a stationary object. Which of the following must be true in order for the object to remain in equilibrium?<br/>A. The magnitudes of all forces acting on the object must be equal.<br/>B. The vector sum of all forces acting on the object must equal zero.<br/>C. All forces acting on the object must act along the same line.<br/>D. The object must have zero net acceleration.<br/>Answer: B. The vector sum of all forces acting on the object must equal zero.<br/>Explanation: Equilibrium requires that there is no net force, meaning the vector sum of all forces must be zero. This ensures no acceleration occurs according to Newton's First Law.<br/><br/>2c. Which of the following quantities is LEAST appropriately described as a vector?<br/>A. Impulse delivered to a ball during a collision<br/>B. The angular momentum of a rotating bicycle wheel<br/>C. The electric potential at a point near a charged particle<br/>D. The displacement of a hiker from the trailhead<br/>Answer: C.

While impulse, angular momentum, and displacement all have magnitude and direction. | 2a. Which of the following best explains why velocity is classified as a vector quantity while speed is not?<br/>A. Velocity includes a reference frame, whereas speed is always measured relative to the ground.<br/>B. Velocity has both magnitude and direction, whereas speed has only magnitude.<br/>C. Velocity is derived from displacement, which is inherently directional, while speed is derived from distance.<br/>D. Velocity is a rate of change of position, while speed is a rate of change of time.<br/>Answer: B. Velocity has both magnitude and direction, whereas speed has only magnitude.<br/>Explanation: By definition, vector quantities require both magnitude and direction, while scalar quantities (like speed) have only magnitude. This distinction is fundamental in kinematics and dynamics.<br/><br/>2b. A student claims that because temperature can be represented with a positive or negative sign (e.g., –10°C), it must be a vector quantity. Which of the following best addresses the flaw in this reasoning?<br/>A. Temperature lacks a spatial direction, which is required for vector classification.<br/>B. The sign in temperature indicates relative scale, not direction in space.<br/>C. Vectors must be represented graphically with arrows, whereas temperature is a numerical value.<br/>D. Only quantities involving motion (e.g., velocity) can be vectors, and temperature is static.<br/>Answer: B. The sign in temperature indicates relative scale, not direction in space.<br/>Explanation: Vectors require a *spatial* direction (e.g., north, upward), not merely algebraic sign. Temperature’s sign reflects a reference point (e.g., below freezing) but no directional component.<br/><br/>2c. In a two-dimensional motion problem, why must acceleration be treated as a vector when analyzing projectile motion?<br/>A. Acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, requiring directional specificity.<br/>B. Projectile motion involves curved paths, which can only be described using vector calculus.<br/>C. The horizontal and vertical components of acceleration are independent and must be resolved separately.<br/>D. Vectors are necessary to distinguish between constant acceleration and uniformly changing velocity.<br/>Answer: A. Acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, requiring directional specificity.<br/>Explanation: In projectile motion, acceleration is exclusively downward (ignoring air resistance), so its *direction* (a vector property) is critical for resolving motion into horizontal and vertical components. Scalar treatment would omit this directional dependence. |
| 3 | Scalars are quantities without direction. Scalar quantities may be the magnitude of vectors, like speed, or may be dimensionless, like coefficients of friction. | 3a.

Which of the following is an example of a scalar quantity?<br/>A. Velocity<br/>B. Displacement<br/>C. Coefficient of friction<br/>D. Acceleration<br/>Answer: C. Coefficient of friction<br/>Explanation: The coefficient of friction is a dimensionless scalar, as it has no direction and does not represent the magnitude of a vector.<br/><br/>3c. A student claims that "speed" and "velocity" are both scalar quantities because they both describe how fast an object moves. Which statement best evaluates this claim?<br/>A. Both are scalar quantities because they describe rate of motion.<br/>B. Only velocity is a scalar because it can be negative.<br/>C. Only speed is a scalar because it lacks direction.<br/>D. Both are vectors because they involve motion.<br/>Answer: C. Only speed is a scalar because it lacks direction.<br/>Explanation: Speed is a scalar as it represents only magnitude, while velocity is a vector because it includes both magnitude and direction. | 3a. Which of the following best describes a scalar quantity?<br/>A. A quantity that requires both magnitude and direction for complete description.<br/>B. A quantity that is always positive.<br/>C. A quantity fully described by magnitude alone.<br/>D. A quantity whose effect depends on its direction.<br/>Answer: C. A quantity fully described by magnitude alone.<br/>Explanation: Scalars, by definition, possess magnitude only. The presence of direction is what differentiates a vector from a scalar. Scalar quantities can indeed be negative (e.g., temperature in Celsius).<br/><br/>3b. Which of the following is NOT a scalar quantity?<br/>A. Work<br/>B. Electric Potential<br/>C. Torque<br/>D. Mass<br/>Answer: C. Torque<br/>Explanation: Work, electric potential, and mass are all scalar quantities, defined only by their magnitude. Torque, however, is a vector quantity, characterized by both a magnitude and a direction (axis of rotation).<br/><br/>3c. An object's velocity is doubled. How does this change affect its speed?<br/>A. The speed is unchanged.<br/>B. The speed is doubled.<br/>C. The speed is halved.<br/>D. The speed depends on the direction of the velocity.<br/>Answer: B. The speed is doubled.<br/>Explanation: Speed is the magnitude of velocity. Since velocity is doubled, the magnitude of the velocity (i.e., the speed) is also doubled. Since speed is a scalar, changes in the direction of velocity do not impact the speed. | 3a. Which of the following statements correctly distinguishes a scalar quantity from a vector quantity?<br/>A. A scalar quantity requires both magnitude and direction, while a vector quantity requires only magnitude.<br/>B. A scalar quantity is fully described by its magnitude, while a vector quantity requires both magnitude and direction.<br/>C. A scalar quantity can be negative, but a vector quantity cannot.<br/>D. A scalar quantity is always dimensionless, whereas a vector quantity always has units.<br/>Answer: B. A scalar quantity is fully described by its magnitude, while a vector quantity requires both magnitude and direction.<br/>Explanation: By definition, scalars lack directional information, whereas vectors require both magnitude and direction for complete description.<br/><br/>3b. A physics student measures the coefficient of friction (μ) between a block and a surface. Which of the following best explains why μ is classified as a scalar quantity?<br/>A. It is derived from the ratio of two vector magnitudes (frictional force and normal force).<br/>B. It has no units, which is a defining feature of all scalar quantities.<br/>C. It is independent of the coordinate system used to measure the forces involved.<br/>D. It is always positive, unlike vector quantities, which can be negative.<br/>Answer: A. It is derived from the ratio of two vector magnitudes (frictional force and normal force).<br/>Explanation: The coefficient of friction is a scalar because it is calculated from the magnitudes of two vectors (friction and normal force), regardless of their directions.<br/><br/>3c. Which of the following scenarios involves a scalar quantity that is NOT the magnitude of a vector?<br/>A. A car’s speedometer displaying 60 km/h.<br/>B. The temperature of a gas increasing by 10°C.<br/>C. The displacement of a runner measured as 200 m north.<br/>D. The work done by a force calculated as 50 J.<br/>Answer: B. The temperature of a gas increasing by 10°C.<br/>Explanation: Temperature is a scalar with no directional component and is not derived from a vector’s magnitude, unlike speed (magnitude of velocity) or work (dot product of force and displacement). |
| 4 | Vector addition may be accomplished using the tip-to-tail method or by breaking a vector into its components and using the Pythagorean theorem. | 4a. Which of the following best describes the tip-to-tail method for vector addition?<br/>A. Placing the tails of all vectors at the origin and measuring the resultant<br/>B. Arranging vectors such that the tip of one vector connects to the tail of the next, then drawing the resultant from the start to the end point<br/>C. Breaking each vector into perpendicular components and summing them algebraically<br/>D. Using only the magnitudes of vectors to find the resultant<br/>Answer: B. Arranging vectors such that the tip of one vector connects to the tail of the next, then drawing the resultant from the start to the end point<br/>Explanation: The tip-to-tail method involves connecting vectors in sequence and drawing the resultant vector from the starting point to the final tip, which visually demonstrates vector addition.<br/><br/>4b. A student needs to find the magnitude of the sum of two perpendicular vectors. Which approach is most appropriate?<br/>A. Add the magnitudes directly<br/>B. Use the tip-to-tail method and measure the resultant vector<br/>C. Break the vectors into components and apply the Pythagorean theorem<br/>D. Subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger one<br/>Answer: C. Break the vectors into components and apply the Pythagorean theorem<br/>Explanation: For perpendicular vectors, the most accurate method is to use their components and apply the Pythagorean theorem to determine the magnitude of the resultant.<br/><br/>4c. Which situation would make the tip-to-tail method less practical compared to the component method?<br/>A. Adding two vectors in the same direction<br/>B. Adding multiple vectors at arbitrary angles in two dimensions<br/>C. Adding two vectors of equal magnitude but opposite direction<br/>D. Adding a single vector to itself<br/>Answer: B. Adding multiple vectors at arbitrary angles in two dimensions<br/>Explanation: When dealing with several vectors at various angles, breaking them into components and summing each component is more systematic and less error-prone than the graphical tip-to-tail method. | 4a. A physics student adds two vectors and finds the magnitude of the resultant vector is zero. Which of the following statements must be true regarding the original vectors?<br/>A. The vectors have equal magnitudes and point in the same direction.<br/>B. The vectors are orthogonal to each other.<br/>C. The vectors have equal magnitudes and point in opposite directions.<br/>D. The vectors have different magnitudes but point in opposite directions.<br/>Answer: C. The vectors have equal magnitudes and point in opposite directions.<br/>Explanation: If the magnitude of the resultant vector is zero, the vectors must perfectly cancel. This only occurs if they have equal magnitudes and are oriented 180 degrees apart, effectively pointing in opposite directions.<br/><br/>4b. A projectile is launched at an angle above the horizontal. Which of the following best describes the most accurate method for determining the net displacement of the projectile?<br/>A. Scalar addition of the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity.<br/>B. Multiplying the magnitude of initial velocity by the total time of flight.<br/>C. Vector addition of the horizontal and vertical displacement components.<br/>D. Summing the magnitudes of the initial and final velocities.<br/>Answer: C. Vector addition of the horizontal and vertical displacement components.<br/>Explanation: Net displacement is a vector quantity. Therefore, adding the horizontal and vertical displacements as vectors (tip-to-tail or with Pythagorean theorem) is the most accurate method, whereas summing scalar values or velocities would provide an incorrect value.<br/><br/>4c. Two students are asked to find the resultant of several displacement vectors. Student 1 accurately determines the x and y components of each vector and sums them. Student 2 accurately determines the magnitude of each vector and sums them. Which student, if either, correctly determined the magnitude of the resultant displacement vector?<br/>A. Only Student 1<br/>B. Only Student 2<br/>C. Both students<br/>D. Neither student<br/>Answer: A. Only Student 1<br/>Explanation: Student 1 performed the correct vector addition using components. Student 2 summed the magnitudes of the individual displacement vectors, which does not account for their directionality and does not yield the magnitude of the resultant vector. | 4a. When two vectors are added using the tip-to-tail method, the resultant vector is drawn from:<br/>A. the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector.<br/>B. the tip of the first vector to the tail of the second vector.<br/>C. the midpoint of the first vector to the midpoint of the second vector.<br/>D. the tail of the second vector to the tip of the first vector.<br/>Answer: A. the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector.<br/>Explanation: The tip-to-tail method requires placing the tail of the second vector at the tip of the first; the resultant is then drawn from the tail of the first to the tip of the last vector.<br/><br/>4b. Which of the following scenarios would make the component method of vector addition more advantageous than the tip-to-tail method?<br/>A. Adding two vectors that are perpendicular to each other.<br/>B. Adding two vectors that have equal magnitudes but unknown angles.<br/>C. Adding three or more vectors with arbitrary directions.<br/>D. Adding two vectors that are parallel and in the same direction.<br/>Answer: C. Adding three or more vectors with arbitrary directions.<br/>Explanation: The component method is more efficient for multiple vectors or non-perpendicular angles, as it systematically breaks vectors into x- and y-components for algebraic addition.<br/><br/>4c. A student adds two vectors, **A** and **B**, using both the tip-to-tail method and the component method but obtains different resultant magnitudes. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?<br/>A. The vectors were not drawn to scale in the tip-to-tail method.<br/>B. The component method inherently introduces rounding errors.<br/>C. The Pythagorean theorem was incorrectly applied to non-right triangles.<br/>D. The student used radians instead of degrees for angle measurements.<br/>Answer: A. The vectors were not drawn to scale in the tip-to-tail method.<br/>Explanation: The tip-to-tail method relies on accurate scaling; if vectors are not drawn to scale, the graphical resultant will differ from the analytical (component) result. The other options are irrelevant or incorrect. |
| 5 | Vector subtraction is accomplished by changing the direction of the subtracted vector and then following the procedures for vector addition. | 5a. Which of the following best describes how to subtract one vector from another?<br/>A. Add the two vectors directly, tail-to-head.<br/>B. Reverse the direction of the vector to be subtracted and then add it to the first vector.<br/>C. Multiply the vectors and then add their magnitudes.<br/>D. Subtract the magnitudes of the vectors without considering direction.<br/>Answer: B.

Reverse the direction of vector B before adding it to vector A.<br/>C. Draw vector B twice as long before adding to vector A.<br/>D. Add vector A and B without altering their directions.<br/>Answer: B. Reverse the direction of vector B before adding it to vector A.<br/>Explanation: To subtract vector B from vector A, vector B's direction is reversed, and the vectors are then added using the standard vector addition procedure.<br/><br/>5c.

Calculate the magnitude of each vector and subtract the smaller from the larger.<br/>Answer: A. Multiply the initial vector by -1 and add it to the vector pointing to B.<br/>Explanation: Vector subtraction A - B is equivalent to A + (-B). This involves inverting the direction of vector B (multiplying by -1) and then performing vector addition with A. This maintains proper directional information.<br/><br/>5b. A pilot needs to determine the plane's displacement relative to its starting point, accounting for wind. The displacement without wind is vector 'P', and the effect of the wind is vector 'W'. Which of the following represents the correct vector operation to find the plane's displacement excluding the wind's influence?<br/>A. P + W<br/>B. P - W<br/>C. W - P<br/>D. -P - W<br/>Answer: B. P - W<br/>Explanation: To find the displacement without wind, we need to subtract the wind's effect (W) from the total displacement (P). This uses the concept that vector subtraction isolates the desired vector by removing the contribution of another.<br/><br/>5c. An object undergoes two successive displacements. Which of the following is true about subtracting the first displacement vector from the second displacement vector?<br/>A. It will always result in a vector with a smaller magnitude than either original displacement vector.<br/>B. It is equivalent to adding the second displacement vector to the negative of the first displacement vector.<br/>C. It will result in a scalar quantity representing the change in distance.<br/>D. It cannot be performed because displacement vectors are always positive.<br/>Answer: B.

Both the magnitude and direction remain unchanged.<br/>Answer: C. The magnitude may change, and the direction reverses.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying by a negative scalar changes the vector’s magnitude (by the absolute value of the scalar) and reverses its direction, which is a fundamental property of vector-scalar multiplication.<br/><br/>6b. If a force vector is multiplied by a positive scalar greater than one, which of the following statements is true?<br/>A. The force's magnitude increases, but its direction remains the same.<br/>B. The force's magnitude decreases, and its direction reverses.<br/>C. Both the magnitude and direction of the force reverse.<br/>D. Only the direction of the force changes.<br/>Answer: A. The force's magnitude increases, but its direction remains the same.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying by a positive scalar increases the vector’s magnitude proportionally without affecting its direction, which is key in vector scaling.<br/><br/>6c. A student claims that multiplying any vector by a scalar always preserves the vector’s direction. Which scenario disproves this claim?<br/>A. Multiplying a velocity vector by 2.<br/>B. Multiplying a displacement vector by 0.5.<br/>C. Multiplying a force vector by -1.<br/>D. Multiplying an acceleration vector by 1.<br/>Answer: C. Multiplying a force vector by -1.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying by a negative scalar reverses the direction of the vector, directly contradicting the student’s claim and highlighting the importance of the scalar’s sign. | 6a. Question text<br/>Which of the following is a true statement regarding the effect of multiplying a vector by a negative scalar?<br/>A. Only the magnitude of the vector changes.<br/>B. Only the direction of the vector changes.<br/>C. Both the magnitude and direction of the vector change.<br/>D. Neither the magnitude nor the direction of the vector changes.<br/>Answer: C. Both the magnitude and direction of the vector change.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying by a negative scalar alters the vector's magnitude by the absolute value of the scalar and reverses its direction by 180 degrees. Thus both properties are affected.<br/><br/>6b. Question text<br/>A displacement vector is multiplied by a scalar value. Under which of the following conditions will the magnitude of the resultant displacement vector be decreased compared to the initial displacement vector?<br/>A. The scalar is any positive number greater than 1.<br/>B. The scalar is any negative number less than -1.<br/>C. The scalar is any positive number less than 1.<br/>D. The scalar is exactly 1.<br/>Answer: C. The scalar is any positive number less than 1.<br/>Explanation: Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar less than one decreases its magnitude; multiplying by a negative scalar less than one also decreases the magnitude because we consider the absolute value of the scalar. A and B increase magnitude; D leaves it unchanged.<br/><br/>6c. Question text<br/>A force vector, F, is multiplied by an unknown scalar 'k' to produce a new force vector, F'. If the direction of F' is opposite to that of F, which of the following statements must be true regarding 'k'?<br/>A. k must be a complex number.<br/>B. k must be zero.<br/>C. k must be a negative number.<br/>D. k must be a positive number.<br/>Answer: C. k must be a negative number.<br/>Explanation: Only a negative scalar can reverse the direction of a vector. A positive scalar would preserve the direction, and zero would result in a null vector. Complex numbers are not used as scalars in this context on the MCAT. | 6a. Which of the following best describes the effect of multiplying a vector by a scalar with a magnitude less than 1 but greater than 0?<br/>A. The vector’s magnitude increases, and its direction remains unchanged.<br/>B. The vector’s magnitude decreases, and its direction remains unchanged.<br/>C. The vector’s magnitude decreases, and its direction reverses.<br/>D. The vector’s magnitude remains constant, but its direction reverses.<br/>Answer: B. The vector’s magnitude decreases, and its direction remains unchanged.<br/>Explanation: Scalar multiplication scales the vector’s magnitude by the scalar’s absolute value; a scalar between 0 and 1 reduces the magnitude without altering direction unless the scalar is negative.<br/><br/>6b. A velocity vector **v** is multiplied by a scalar of –2. Which statement about the resulting vector is correct?<br/>A. The magnitude doubles, and the direction is reversed.<br/>B. The magnitude halves, and the direction is reversed.<br/>C. The magnitude doubles, and the direction remains the same.<br/>D. The magnitude remains the same, but the direction is reversed.<br/>Answer: A. The magnitude doubles, and the direction is reversed.<br/>Explanation: A negative scalar scales the magnitude by its absolute value (here, 2) and reverses the vector’s direction, as the sign indicates orientation.<br/><br/>6c. Which scenario demonstrates a scalar multiplication that does NOT alter the direction of the original vector?<br/>A. A displacement vector scaled by –1.5<br/>B. A force vector scaled by 0.75<br/>C. An acceleration vector scaled by –0.5<br/>D. A momentum vector scaled by –2.0<br/>Answer: B. A force vector scaled by 0.75<br/>Explanation: Only a positive scalar preserves the original direction; negative scalars reverse it, and zero would nullify the vector entirely. |

Which of the following best describes the result of taking the dot product of two nonzero vectors?<br/>A. A new vector perpendicular to both original vectors<br/>B. A scalar quantity representing the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them<br/>C. A matrix containing the components of both vectors<br/>D. A vector with magnitude equal to the sum of the original vectors’ magnitudes<br/>Answer: B. A scalar quantity representing the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them<br/>Explanation: The dot product of two vectors yields a scalar, not a vector, and is calculated as the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them.<br/><br/>7b. If the dot product of two nonzero vectors is zero, what can be concluded about the relationship between the vectors?<br/>A. The vectors are parallel<br/>B. The vectors are perpendicular<br/>C. The vectors have equal magnitudes<br/>D. The vectors point in the same direction<br/>Answer: B. The vectors are perpendicular<br/>Explanation: A dot product of zero means the cosine of the angle between the vectors is zero, indicating the vectors are perpendicular.<br/><br/>7c. Which of the following operations differs from the dot product in both its result and its geometric interpretation?<br/>A. Adding two vectors<br/>B. Multiplying two vectors using the cross product<br/>C. Multiplying a vector by a scalar<br/>D. Subtracting one vector from another<br/>Answer: B. Multiplying two vectors using the cross product<br/>Explanation: The cross product yields a vector perpendicular to the original vectors, whereas the dot product yields a scalar; their geometric interpretations and results are fundamentally different. | 7a. Question text<br/>Which of the following is a fundamental difference between the result of a dot product operation and a cross product operation performed on two vectors?<br/>A. The dot product only exists in two dimensions, while the cross product exists in three dimensions.<br/>B. The dot product is dependent on the sine of the angle between the vectors, while the cross product is dependent on the cosine.<br/>C. The dot product produces a scalar quantity, while the cross product produces a vector quantity.<br/>D. The dot product is undefined when the vectors are parallel, while the cross product is undefined when the vectors are perpendicular.<br/>Answer: C. The dot product produces a scalar quantity, while the cross product produces a vector quantity.<br/>Explanation: The key distinction lies in the nature of the resulting quantity. The dot product, by definition, yields a scalar. Cross products, on the other hand, generate vectors. Understanding scalar vs. vector results is crucial for vector algebra on the MCAT.<br/><br/>7b. Question text<br/>Two vectors, *A* and *B*, have magnitudes of 5 and 10 units, respectively. If their dot product is zero, which of the following must be true?<br/>A. Vectors *A* and *B* are parallel.<br/>B. Vectors *A* and *B* are anti-parallel.<br/>C. The angle between vectors *A* and *B* is 90 degrees.<br/>D. The angle between vectors *A* and *B* is 0 degrees.<br/>Answer: C. The angle between vectors *A* and *B* is 90 degrees.<br/>Explanation: The dot product is zero when cos(θ) is zero. This occurs when the angle θ between the vectors is 90 degrees. This reflects the orthogonality of the vectors when their dot product vanishes.<br/><br/>7c. Question text<br/>Which of the following physical quantities can be correctly calculated using a dot product operation?<br/>A. The torque exerted by a force on a lever arm.<br/>B. The work done by a force acting on an object.<br/>C. The angular momentum of a rotating object.<br/>D. The magnetic force on a moving charge.<br/>Answer: B. The work done by a force acting on an object.<br/>Explanation: Work is defined as the dot product of the force and displacement vectors (W = F · d). The dot product yields a scalar quantity representing the component of force acting along the direction of displacement. Torque, angular momentum, and magnetic force are vector quantities determined by cross products. | 7a. Which of the following best describes the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors **A** and **B**?<br/>A. The area of the parallelogram formed by **A** and **B**<br/>B. The length of the projection of **A** onto **B**, scaled by the magnitude of **B**<br/>C. The product of the vectors' magnitudes and the sine of the angle between them<br/>D. The magnitude of the cross product of **A** and **B**<br/>Answer: B. The length of the projection of **A** onto **B**, scaled by the magnitude of **B**<br/>Explanation: The dot product **A**·**B** = \|**A**\|\|**B**\|cosθ represents the projection of **A** onto **B** multiplied by \|**B**\|, yielding a scalar that reflects how much of **A** lies in the direction of **B**.<br/><br/>7b. A physics student claims that if the dot product of two nonzero vectors is zero, the vectors must be perpendicular. Which of the following statements most accurately evaluates this claim?<br/>A. The claim is false because the dot product is zero only when at least one vector has zero magnitude.<br/>B. The claim is true because cos(90°) = 0, making the dot product zero for perpendicular vectors.<br/>C. The claim is false because the dot product can be zero for any angle, not just 90°.<br/>D. The claim is true only if the vectors are unit vectors.<br/>Answer: B. The claim is true because cos(90°) = 0, making the dot product zero for perpendicular vectors.<br/>Explanation: The dot product equals \|**A**\|\|**B**\|cosθ, and since cos(90°) = 0, nonzero vectors with θ = 90° will always yield a dot product of zero, confirming perpendicularity.<br/><br/>7c. Which scenario would result in the maximum possible positive value of the dot product for two vectors of fixed magnitudes?<br/>A. The vectors are oriented at 45° to each other.<br/>B. The vectors are antiparallel (180° apart).<br/>C. The vectors are parallel (0° apart).<br/>D. The vectors are perpendicular (90° apart).<br/>Answer: C. The vectors are parallel (0° apart).<br/>Explanation: The dot product is maximized when cosθ is maximized (cosθ = 1 at θ = 0°), meaning the vectors are parallel and point in the same direction, yielding the product of their magnitudes. |

Point your right fingers in the direction of the first vector and curl them toward the second vector; your thumb points in the direction of the cross product.<br/>Explanation: The right-hand rule involves using your right hand to orient the direction of the cross product vector, which is perpendicular to the plane formed by the two original vectors.<br/><br/>8c. Which scenario would result in a zero vector when calculating the cross product of two vectors?<br/>A. The two vectors are perpendicular to each other.<br/>B. The two vectors are parallel to each other.<br/>C. The two vectors have equal magnitudes.<br/>D. The two vectors are in opposite directions but not parallel.<br/>Answer: B. The two vectors are parallel to each other.<br/>Explanation: The cross product depends on the sine of the angle between the vectors; when the vectors are parallel (angle = 0° or 180°), the sine is zero, resulting in a zero vector. | 8a. Question text<br/>Which of the following statements regarding the cross product of two vectors is always true?<br/>A. The resultant vector is parallel to both original vectors.<br/>B. The resultant vector is perpendicular to the plane formed by the original vectors.<br/>C. The resultant vector's magnitude is maximized when the original vectors are parallel.<br/>D. The cross product always results in a scalar quantity.<br/>Answer: B. The resultant vector is perpendicular to the plane formed by the original vectors.<br/>Explanation: The cross product, by definition, yields a vector that is orthogonal to both original vectors. This means it's perpendicular to the plane they span.<br/><br/>8b. Question text<br/>Two vectors, *A* and *B*, are oriented such that their cross product is zero. Which of the following must be true regarding the orientation of vectors *A* and *B*?<br/>A. *A* and *B* are perpendicular.<br/>B. *A* and *B* are parallel or antiparallel.<br/>C. The magnitude of either *A* or *B* is zero.<br/>D. The dot product of *A* and *B* is also zero.<br/>Answer: B. *A* and *B* are parallel or antiparallel.<br/>Explanation: The cross product's magnitude depends on sin(theta). Sin(0) = 0 and sin(180) = 0. Therefore, the vectors are parallel or antiparallel when the cross product is zero.<br/><br/>8c. Question text<br/>A torque is applied to a wrench using a force vector *F* at a position vector *r* relative to the bolt. If the magnitude of *r* remains constant, which of the following scenarios would maximize the magnitude of the resulting torque vector?<br/>A.

| 9 | Displacement is the vector representation of a change in position. It is path independent and is equivalent to the straight line distance between the start and end locations. | 9a. Which of the following statements best describes displacement in physics?<br/>A. Displacement is the total length of the path traveled by an object.<br/>B. Displacement is a scalar quantity representing how far an object has moved.<br/>C. Displacement is a vector quantity representing the straight line change in position from start to end.<br/>D. Displacement is always equal to the distance traveled.<br/>Answer: C. Displacement is a vector quantity representing the straight line change in position from start to end.<br/>Explanation: Displacement is a vector that depends only on the initial and final positions, not on the path taken, and points from start to finish.<br/><br/>9b. A runner completes a full lap around a 400-meter circular track, ending at her starting point. What is her displacement?<br/>A. 400 meters, along the path of the track<br/>B. 0 meters, because her final and initial positions are the same<br/>C. 800 meters, accounting for the round trip<br/>D. 400 meters, in the direction opposite to the start<br/>Answer: B. 0 meters, because her final and initial positions are the same<br/>Explanation: Displacement depends only on the change in position, not the path; returning to the starting point yields zero displacement.<br/><br/>9c. Which scenario demonstrates the path independence of displacement?<br/>A. A hiker walks up a winding trail and returns by the same path.<br/>B. A car drives from point A to point B using the shortest possible route.<br/>C. Two people travel from the same starting point to the same endpoint using different routes, but their displacements are equal.<br/>D. A cyclist rides in a circle and stops halfway around.<br/>Answer: C. Two people travel from the same starting point to the same endpoint using different routes, but their displacements are equal.<br/>Explanation: Displacement is determined only by the initial and final positions, so the path taken does not affect its magnitude or direction. | 9a. A hiker completes a loop trail, starting and ending at the same point. What is the magnitude of the hiker's displacement?<br/>A. Equal to the total distance traveled<br/>B. Equal to zero<br/>C. Proportional to the average speed<br/>D. Dependent on the trail's maximum elevation<br/>Answer: B. Equal to zero<br/>Explanation: Displacement is a vector quantity representing the change in position. Since the hiker returns to the starting point, there is no net change in position, resulting in zero displacement regardless of the path taken.<br/><br/>9b. Two objects move from point A to point B. Object 1 takes a curved path, while object 2 takes a straight path. Which of the following statements is true regarding their displacements?<br/>A. Object 1's displacement is greater than object 2's.<br/>B. Object 2's displacement is greater than object 1's.<br/>C. Their displacements are equal.<br/>D. The relationship between their displacements depends on their average speeds.<br/>Answer: C. Their displacements are equal.<br/>Explanation: Displacement is path-independent; it only considers the initial and final positions. Since both objects start at A and end at B, their displacements are identical, irrespective of their trajectories.<br/><br/>9c. Which of the following scenarios illustrates a situation where an object's displacement magnitude and distance traveled are equal?<br/>A. A car driving around a circular track at a constant speed.<br/>B. A ball thrown vertically upward, returning to the same height.<br/>C. An elevator traveling directly upwards from the ground floor to the tenth floor.<br/>D. A pendulum swinging back and forth.<br/>Answer: C. An elevator traveling directly upwards from the ground floor to the tenth floor.<br/>Explanation: Distance and magnitude of displacement are equal only when motion occurs along a straight line in one direction without any change in direction. The elevator going directly upwards satisfies this condition. | 9a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between displacement and the actual path taken by an object?<br/>A. Displacement is always greater than or equal to the distance traveled along the path.<br/>B. Displacement is a scalar quantity that depends on the total length of the path.<br/>C. Displacement is a vector quantity that is independent of the path taken.<br/>D. Displacement is equivalent to the total distance traveled only when motion is circular.<br/>Answer: C. Displacement is a vector quantity that is independent of the path taken.<br/>Explanation: Displacement is defined as the straight-line vector from the initial to final position, making it path-independent, unlike distance, which is a scalar and depends on the path.<br/><br/>9b. A hiker walks 3 km north, then 4 km east, and finally 3 km south. Which of the following statements about the hiker’s displacement is true?<br/>A. The displacement is zero because the hiker returns to the starting latitude.<br/>B. The displacement is 7 km in the eastward direction.<br/>C. The displacement is 4 km east, since north and south components cancel.<br/>D. The displacement cannot be determined without knowing the hiker’s speed.<br/>Answer: C. The displacement is 4 km east, since north and south components cancel.<br/>Explanation: Displacement is the net change in position; the north and south segments cancel, leaving only the eastward component as the resultant vector.<br/><br/>9c. Which scenario demonstrates that displacement is a vector quantity rather than a scalar quantity?<br/>A. A car’s odometer reads 50 km after a trip, regardless of the route taken.<br/>B. Two runners finish a race at the same location but take different paths; their displacements are identical.<br/>C. The speed of an object is constant, but its velocity changes due to direction changes.<br/>D. The total time taken for a journey is the same whether traveling in a straight line or a curved path.<br/>Answer: B. Two runners finish a race at the same location but take different paths; their displacements are identical.<br/>Explanation: Displacement’s vector nature is evident when different paths yield the same net change in position (magnitude and direction), unlike scalars (e.g., distance), which depend on the path. |

Distance is a vector quantity representing the straight-line change in position.<br/>B. Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total length of the path traveled.<br/>C. Distance is a vector quantity that includes direction.<br/>D. Distance is the shortest path between two points.<br/>Answer: B. Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total length of the path traveled.<br/>Explanation: Distance measures the actual path length traveled regardless of direction, making it a scalar quantity, unlike displacement, which is a vector.<br/><br/>10b. If a person walks 3 meters east, then 4 meters west, what does their distance traveled represent?<br/>A. The net change in their position from start to finish<br/>B. The shortest path between their starting and ending points<br/>C. The total length of the path they walked<br/>D. The direction of their movement<br/>Answer: C. The total length of the path they walked<br/>Explanation: Distance is the sum of the entire path traveled, regardless of direction or net displacement.<br/><br/>10c. Which of the following distinguishes distance from displacement?<br/>A. Distance can be negative, while displacement cannot.<br/>B. Distance depends on the path taken, while displacement depends only on initial and final positions.<br/>C. Distance is always less than or equal to displacement.<br/>D. Distance requires direction, while displacement does not.<br/>Answer: B. Distance depends on the path taken, while displacement depends only on initial and final positions.<br/>Explanation: Distance reflects the actual path length traveled (a scalar), while displacement is a vector defined by the straight-line change from initial to final position. | 10a. Which of the following best exemplifies why distance is categorized as a scalar quantity?<br/>A. Distance involves both magnitude and direction.<br/>B. Distance only requires magnitude for its complete description.<br/>C. Distance is always equal to the displacement of an object.<br/>D. Distance can be negative, indicating a change in direction.<br/>Answer: B. Distance only requires magnitude for its complete description.<br/>Explanation: Scalar quantities, like distance, are fully described by their magnitude alone. Direction is irrelevant, unlike vector quantities. The MCAT emphasizes distinguishing between scalar and vector quantities.<br/><br/>10b. A hiker traverses a winding trail. Which statement accurately describes the relationship between the total distance the hiker travels and the straight-line displacement from their starting point?<br/>A. The distance will always be less than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement.<br/>B. The distance and the magnitude of the displacement will always be equal.<br/>C. The distance will always be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement.<br/>D. The distance is independent of the displacement, as they measure different properties.<br/>Answer: C. The distance will always be greater than or equal to the magnitude of the displacement.<br/>Explanation: Distance accounts for the entire path traveled, whereas displacement is the shortest straight-line path. Therefore, the distance must be equal to or longer than the displacement's magnitude, testing conceptual understanding of these definitions.<br/><br/>10c. Two objects move from point A to point B. Object 1 follows a direct straight path. Object 2 follows a curved, longer path. Which of the following quantities must be different for the two objects?<br/>A. Final velocity.<br/>B. Final kinetic energy.<br/>C. Distance traveled.<br/>D. Average acceleration.<br/>Answer: C. Distance traveled.<br/>Explanation: Since Object 2 travels a longer path than Object 1, the distance traveled by each object must be different. The other quantities could be the same if their speeds and direction are properly manipulated. | 10a. Which of the following best explains why distance is classified as a scalar quantity?<br/>A. It is always measured in meters and has no associated direction.<br/>B. It fully describes an object’s motion by incorporating both magnitude and direction.<br/>C. It represents the straight-line separation between two points in space.<br/>D. It is derived from vector components but lacks a defined coordinate system.<br/>Answer: A. It is always measured in meters and has no associated direction.<br/>Explanation: A scalar quantity is defined solely by its magnitude, without direction; distance meets this criterion as it measures the total path length traveled, independent of direction.<br/><br/>10b. A runner completes a 400-meter lap around a circular track. Which of the following quantities would change if the runner’s path were altered to include sharp turns but the same total path length?<br/>A. Displacement<br/>B. Distance<br/>C. Speed<br/>D. Velocity<br/>Answer: A. Displacement<br/>Explanation: Distance is a scalar representing total path length and remains unchanged regardless of path shape, whereas displacement (a vector) depends on the straight-line separation between start and end points and would vary with path alterations.<br/><br/>10c. Which scenario demonstrates that distance and displacement can have identical magnitudes?<br/>A. A car drives 5 km north and then 3 km east.<br/>B. A ball rolls 10 m along a curved path and ends at its starting point.<br/>C. A hiker walks 2 km west and then 2 km east.<br/>D. A projectile is launched and lands at the same height 50 m away.<br/>Answer: D. A projectile is launched and lands at the same height 50 m away.<br/>Explanation: When an object’s path is straight or symmetric (e.g., projectile motion with equal launch and landing heights), the scalar distance (total path) can equal the magnitude of the displacement (straight-line separation). Options A–C involve net displacements smaller than the total distance. |
| 11 | Velocity is the vector representation of the change in displacement with respect to time. | 11a. Which of the following best describes velocity as used in physics?<br/>A. The rate of change of distance with respect to time<br/>B. The vector representation of the change in displacement with respect to time<br/>C. The magnitude of the speed of an object at a given instant<br/>D. The total distance traveled divided by total time<br/>Answer: B. The vector representation of the change in displacement with respect to time<br/>Explanation: Velocity is defined as a vector quantity representing the rate at which an object's displacement changes over time, distinguishing it from speed, which is scalar.<br/><br/>11b. If an object moves in a straight line and reverses direction, how does its velocity change?<br/>A. The magnitude of velocity remains constant, but the direction reverses<br/>B. The velocity remains unchanged<br/>C. The velocity becomes zero regardless of motion<br/>D. The velocity increases in the original direction<br/>Answer: A. The magnitude of velocity remains constant, but the direction reverses<br/>Explanation: Velocity, being a vector, depends on both magnitude and direction; reversing direction changes the sign (direction) of velocity even if speed (magnitude) stays the same.<br/><br/>11c. Which statement correctly distinguishes between speed and velocity?<br/>A. Both are vectors that describe how fast an object moves<br/>B. Speed is a vector; velocity is a scalar<br/>C. Speed is based on total distance, while velocity is based on displacement and has direction<br/>D. Speed and velocity are always equal in magnitude and direction<br/>Answer: C. Speed is based on total distance, while velocity is based on displacement and has direction<br/>Explanation: Speed is a scalar measuring total distance per unit time, while velocity is a vector measuring displacement per unit time and includes direction. | 11a. Question text<br/>Which of the following best describes the relationship between instantaneous velocity and displacement?<br/>A. Instantaneous velocity is the scalar magnitude of the displacement vector.<br/>B. Instantaneous velocity is the time derivative of the displacement vector.<br/>C. Instantaneous velocity is the integral of the displacement vector with respect to time.<br/>D. Instantaneous velocity is the displacement vector divided by the total distance traveled.<br/>Answer: B. Instantaneous velocity is the time derivative of the displacement vector.<br/>Explanation: Velocity, being the change in displacement with respect to time, is mathematically represented as the derivative of the displacement vector with respect to time. The other options misrepresent this fundamental relationship.<br/><br/>11b. Question text<br/>A car travels around a circular track at a constant speed. Which statement accurately describes its velocity?<br/>A. The car's velocity is constant because its speed is constant.<br/>B. The car's velocity is changing because its direction is changing.<br/>C. The car's velocity is zero because its displacement over one lap is zero.<br/>D. The car's velocity is constant only at specific points on the track.<br/>Answer: B. The car's velocity is changing because its direction is changing.<br/>Explanation: Velocity is a vector, possessing both magnitude (speed) and direction. Even with constant speed, a changing direction implies a changing velocity. A circular path inherently involves continuous directional changes.<br/><br/>11c. Question text<br/>Consider two objects, A and B. Object A has a greater change in displacement over the same time interval as object B. Which of the following must be true?<br/>A. Object A has a greater average acceleration than object B.<br/>B. Object A has a greater average speed than object B.<br/>C. Object A has a greater average velocity magnitude than object B.<br/>D. Object A and object B experience the same net force.<br/>Answer: C. Object A has a greater average velocity magnitude than object B.<br/>Explanation: Average velocity is displacement divided by time. A greater change in displacement over the same time interval directly indicates a greater average velocity magnitude, though not necessarily greater speed (due to differences in path length). Acceleration and net force cannot be directly determined from displacement alone. | 11a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between velocity and displacement?<br/><br/>11b. A car travels in a circular path at a constant speed. Which of the following statements about its velocity is correct?<br/><br/>11c. Which scenario demonstrates a nonzero velocity but zero net displacement? |

The rate at which distance is covered, regardless of direction<br/>B. The total displacement divided by the total time taken<br/>C. The instantaneous speed at a specific moment<br/>D. The total distance traveled divided by the total time taken<br/>Answer: B. The total displacement divided by the total time taken<br/>Explanation: Average velocity is defined as the total displacement (a vector quantity) divided by the total time, distinguishing it from speed, which uses total distance.<br/><br/>12b. A car travels 100 meters east and then 100 meters west, returning to its starting point in 50 seconds. What is the car’s average velocity for the entire trip?<br/>A. 0 m/s<br/>B. 2 m/s east<br/>C. 4 m/s west<br/>D. 200 m/s east<br/>Answer: A. 0 m/s<br/>Explanation: Since the car’s displacement is zero (it returns to the starting point), the average velocity, which depends on displacement, is also zero.<br/><br/>12c. Which scenario would result in an average velocity that is different from the average speed for a moving object?<br/>A. The object moves in a straight line without changing direction.<br/>B. The object moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point.<br/>C. The object moves at constant speed in one direction.<br/>D. The object is stationary throughout the observation period.<br/>Answer: B. The object moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point.<br/>Explanation: When an object returns to its starting point, displacement is zero, so average velocity is zero, while average speed (based on total distance) is not zero. | 12a. Question text<br/>A hiker completes a loop trail, returning to their starting point. Which of the following statements MUST be true regarding their average velocity for the entire hike?<br/>A. The average velocity is equal to the average speed.<br/>B. The average velocity is positive.<br/>C. The average velocity is zero.<br/>D. The average velocity is negative.<br/>Answer: C. The average velocity is zero.<br/>Explanation: Average velocity is displacement divided by time. Since the hiker returns to the starting point, the total displacement is zero, making the average velocity zero, regardless of the time taken.<br/><br/>12b. Question text<br/>A train travels from City A to City B at a constant velocity and then immediately returns to City A at the same constant speed. Which of the following best describes the relationship between the train's average velocity for the entire trip and its instantaneous velocities at various points during the trip?<br/>A. The average velocity is equal to the arithmetic mean of all instantaneous velocities.<br/>B. The average velocity is equal to the instantaneous velocity at the midpoint of the journey.<br/>C. The average velocity is zero, regardless of the instantaneous velocities.<br/>D. The average velocity is equal to the root mean square of all the instantaneous velocities.<br/>Answer: C. The average velocity is zero, regardless of the instantaneous velocities.<br/>Explanation: The average velocity depends only on the total displacement. As the train ends at its origin, the average velocity must be zero even though there are non-zero instantaneous velocities.<br/><br/>12c. Question text<br/>An object's motion is graphed as its position versus time. Which aspect of the graph directly corresponds to the object's average velocity over a given time interval?<br/>A. The area under the curve.<br/>B. The slope of the curve at a specific point.<br/>C. The length of the curve.<br/>D. The slope of the line connecting the start and end points of the interval.<br/>Answer: D. The slope of the line connecting the start and end points of the interval.<br/>Explanation: Average velocity is displacement/time. On a position vs time graph, displacement is the change in position (final minus initial), and time is the interval. The slope of the line connecting the endpoints represents change in position divided by change in time, thus the average velocity. | 12a. Which of the following scenarios would result in an average velocity of zero?<br/><br/>12b. Which statement correctly distinguishes average velocity from average speed?<br/><br/>12c. A student claims that if an object’s average velocity over an interval is non-zero, its instantaneous velocity at every point during that interval must also be non-zero. Which principle most directly refutes this claim? |

Her total displacement divided by total time<br/>C. Her total distance traveled divided by total time<br/>D. Her instantaneous speed at the finish line<br/>Answer: C. Her total distance traveled divided by total time<br/>Explanation: Average speed is calculated using the total path length (distance) covered, not the net displacement, divided by the total time.<br/><br/>13c. Which scenario would result in the average speed being equal to the magnitude of the average velocity?<br/>A. Running around a closed track and finishing at the starting point<br/>B. Driving from one city to another in a straight line without reversing<br/>C. Walking back and forth along the same path multiple times<br/>D. Cycling in a circle and stopping where you began<br/>Answer: B. Driving from one city to another in a straight line without reversing<br/>Explanation: When motion occurs in a straight line without changing direction, total distance equals displacement, making average speed equal to the magnitude of average velocity. | 13a. A race car completes a lap on a circular track. What can be definitively stated about the car's average speed for that lap?<br/>A. It is equal to the instantaneous speed at some point during the lap.<br/>B. It is greater than zero.<br/>C. It is equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.<br/>D. It is zero.<br/>Answer: B. It is greater than zero.<br/>Explanation: Average speed is the total distance divided by total time. Since the car covered a distance (the circumference of the track) in a non-zero time, the average speed must be greater than zero. The race car is always moving, so the average speed is always a positive quantity.<br/><br/>13b. Two runners complete a 100-meter dash. Runner A completes the race in 10 seconds, while Runner B completes the race in 12 seconds. Which of the following is true regarding the average speeds of the runners?<br/>A. The average speed of Runner A is greater because they covered the same distance in less time.<br/>B. The average speed of Runner B is greater because they had a lower instantaneous speed at the finish line.<br/>C. The average speeds are equal because the displacement is the same for both runners.<br/>D. The average speed cannot be determined without knowing the instantaneous speeds at various points in the race.<br/>Answer: A. The average speed of Runner A is greater because they covered the same distance in less time.<br/>Explanation: Since average speed is total distance divided by total time, the runner who covers the same distance in less time has a higher average speed. Average speed considers the entire duration and distance, not just the final moment.<br/><br/>13c. A child walks 5 meters east, then 5 meters north, then 5 meters west. If the entire trip takes 30 seconds, which statement is correct?<br/>A. The average speed is zero because the child ends up close to where they started.<br/>B. The average speed is 1 m/s.<br/>C. The average speed is 0.5 m/s.<br/>D. The average speed is less than the magnitude of the average velocity.<br/>Answer: C. The average speed is 0.5 m/s.<br/>Explanation: Average speed is total distance (5+5+5 = 15m) divided by total time (30s), so 15m/30s = 0.5 m/s. Distance is path dependent while average speed considers the total scalar distance and not the vector displacement. | 13a. Which of the following scenarios best illustrates why average speed is a scalar quantity rather than a vector quantity?<br/>A. A car travels 60 km north and then 80 km east in 2 hours, resulting in an average speed of 70 km/h.<br/>B. A runner completes a 400 m circular track in 50 seconds, with an average speed of 8 m/s.<br/>C. A projectile is launched at 30° above the horizontal, and its average speed is calculated over its entire flight time.<br/>D. A boat drifts 5 km downstream in 1 hour, then returns 3 km upstream in 0.5 hours, yielding an average speed of 6.33 km/h.<br/>Answer: B. A runner completes a 400 m circular track in 50 seconds, with an average speed of 8 m/s.<br/>Explanation: Average speed depends only on total distance (a scalar) and total time, not direction; the circular path in (B) emphasizes that displacement (a vector) is irrelevant to speed, unlike velocity.<br/><br/>13b. A student claims that average speed and average velocity must always be equal in magnitude. Under which condition would this statement be true?<br/>A. When the motion occurs in a straight line without any reversal in direction.<br/>B. When the total displacement is zero, regardless of the path taken.<br/>C. When the object’s acceleration is constant throughout the motion.<br/>D. When the object returns to its starting point after traveling a non-zero distance.<br/>Answer: A. When the motion occurs in a straight line without any reversal in direction.<br/>Explanation: Average speed equals average velocity’s magnitude only if the path is unidirectional (no direction changes), ensuring total distance equals total displacement magnitude.<br/><br/>13c. Which of the following graphs could NOT represent an object with a non-zero average speed over a given time interval?<br/>A. A position vs. time graph with a horizontal line segment (zero slope) followed by a positively sloped segment.<br/>B. A velocity vs. time graph where the area under the curve is zero over the interval.<br/>C. A position vs. time graph with a sinusoidal (wave-like) pattern over the interval.<br/>D. A velocity vs. time graph with a constant negative slope over the interval.<br/>Answer: B. A velocity vs. time graph where the area under the curve is zero over the interval.<br/>Explanation: Zero area under a velocity-time graph implies zero *displacement*, but if the object moved (non-zero distance), average speed would be non-zero; this scenario violates the definition unless distance is also zero. |

Use the car’s speedometer reading at the end of the journey<br/>D. Average the car’s velocity over several seconds<br/>Answer: B. Calculate the slope of the position vs. time graph at that instant<br/>Explanation: The slope of the position versus time graph at a particular point gives the instantaneous velocity at that time, reflecting the limit as the time interval approaches zero.<br/><br/>14c. Which statement correctly distinguishes instantaneous velocity from average velocity?<br/>A. Instantaneous velocity is always greater than average velocity<br/>B. Average velocity considers infinitesimally small time intervals, while instantaneous velocity does not<br/>C. Instantaneous velocity describes motion at a single moment, whereas average velocity describes motion over a finite interval<br/>D. Both are calculated using the same method for any time interval<br/>Answer: C. Instantaneous velocity describes motion at a single moment, whereas average velocity describes motion over a finite interval<br/>Explanation: Instantaneous velocity is defined at a specific instant (as Δt approaches zero), while average velocity is calculated over a measurable time interval. | 14a.

Instantaneous velocity is the average velocity over a finite time interval.<br/>B. Instantaneous velocity is the derivative of average velocity with respect to time.<br/>C. Instantaneous velocity is the limit of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero.<br/>D. Instantaneous velocity is the integral of average velocity with respect to time.<br/>Answer: C. Instantaneous velocity is the limit of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero.<br/>Explanation: Instantaneous velocity is defined as the limit of the change in displacement divided by the change in time, as the change in time approaches zero. This is the definition of the instantaneous rate of change and is the same as the limit of average velocity.<br/><br/>14b. Question text<br/>A particle's position is recorded at many points in time to create a displacement vs. time graph. What graphical feature of this graph represents the particle's instantaneous velocity at a specific point in time?<br/>A. The area under the displacement vs. time curve.<br/>B. The slope of the displacement vs. time curve at that point.<br/>C. The y-intercept of the displacement vs. time curve.<br/>D. The average height of the displacement vs. time curve.<br/>Answer: B. The slope of the displacement vs. time curve at that point.<br/>Explanation: The slope of a displacement vs. time graph represents the rate of change of displacement with respect to time, which is the definition of velocity. The instantaneous velocity is the slope at a single point in time.<br/><br/>14c. Question text<br/>A race car's speedometer displays a constant reading of 200 km/h. Which of the following statements is necessarily true regarding the race car's instantaneous velocity?<br/>A. The instantaneous velocity is constantly changing.<br/>B. The instantaneous velocity is zero.<br/>C. The instantaneous velocity is constant and equal to 200 km/h in magnitude.<br/>D. The instantaneous velocity can only be determined knowing the car's initial position.<br/>Answer: C. The instantaneous velocity is constant and equal to 200 km/h in magnitude.<br/>Explanation: The speedometer displays the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity (speed). If the speedometer reading is constant, then the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity is also constant. | 14a.

A car reverses direction while moving along a straight path. Which statement correctly describes the car’s instantaneous speed and instantaneous velocity at the moment it changes direction?<br/>A. Instantaneous speed and velocity are both zero.<br/>B. Instantaneous speed is zero, but instantaneous velocity is nonzero.<br/>C. Instantaneous speed is nonzero, but instantaneous velocity is zero.<br/>D. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity, regardless of direction.<br/>Answer: D. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity, regardless of direction.<br/>Explanation: Instantaneous speed is always the magnitude of the velocity vector, so it is non-negative and independent of direction, even if the object changes direction.<br/><br/>15c. Which scenario illustrates a case where instantaneous speed and instantaneous velocity have different values?<br/>A. An object moving in a straight line at constant speed.<br/>B. An object at rest.<br/>C. An object moving in a circle at constant speed.<br/>D. An object accelerating in a straight line.<br/>Answer: C. An object moving in a circle at constant speed.<br/>Explanation: In circular motion, the instantaneous velocity is always tangent to the path (changing direction), but its magnitude (instantaneous speed) remains constant; the direction differs, but the magnitude does not, highlighting their distinction. | 15a. What remains unchanged when an object reverses direction while maintaining constant instantaneous speed?<br/>A. The object's instantaneous velocity vector<br/>B. The object's average velocity<br/>C. The magnitude of the object's instantaneous velocity vector<br/>D. The object's displacement<br/>Answer: C. The magnitude of the object's instantaneous velocity vector<br/>Explanation: Instantaneous speed, a scalar, is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vector.

The car's instantaneous velocity changes, but its instantaneous speed is constant.<br/>D. The car's instantaneous velocity and instantaneous speed both change.<br/>Answer: C. The car's instantaneous velocity changes, but its instantaneous speed is constant.<br/>Explanation: Velocity is a vector and changes due to changing direction, even at constant speed. Instantaneous speed, being a scalar magnitude, only depends on the rate of motion, which is specified as constant. | 15a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between instantaneous speed and instantaneous velocity?<br/><br/>15b. A car’s speedometer reads 60 km/h at a given moment. Which of the following statements about its instantaneous velocity is necessarily true?<br/><br/>15c. Which scenario demonstrates that an object’s instantaneous speed can remain constant while its instantaneous velocity changes? |

A property of matter that resists any change in motion<br/>B. A push or pull that has the potential to result in an acceleration<br/>C. The energy required to move an object<br/>D. The rate of change of velocity with respect to time<br/>Answer: B. A push or pull that has the potential to result in an acceleration<br/>Explanation: In classical mechanics, a force is defined as a push or pull that can cause an object to accelerate, aligning with Newton's second law.<br/><br/>16b. An object is moving at constant velocity on a frictionless surface. Which statement about the forces acting on the object is most accurate?<br/>A. There must be a net force causing the object to continue moving<br/>B. The object must be experiencing a force equal to its mass times its velocity<br/>C. There is no net force acting on the object<br/>D. The object must be experiencing a force opposite to its direction of motion<br/>Answer: C. There is no net force acting on the object<br/>Explanation: According to Newton's first law, an object in motion remains in motion at constant velocity if no net force acts upon it.<br/><br/>16c. Which scenario demonstrates the distinction between the presence of a force and the occurrence of acceleration?<br/>A. A book resting on a table with gravity acting downward and the table providing an upward normal force<br/>B. An object in free fall accelerating toward the ground<br/>C. A car speeding up as it moves down a hill<br/>D. A satellite moving at constant speed in a circular orbit<br/>Answer: A. A book resting on a table with gravity acting downward and the table providing an upward normal force<br/>Explanation: Although forces are present (gravity and normal force), they balance each other, resulting in no acceleration—illustrating that force must be unbalanced to cause acceleration. | 16a. Question text<br/>Which of the following best describes the fundamental nature of a force?<br/>A. A measure of an object's resistance to changes in motion.<br/>B. A form of energy that can do work.<br/>C. An interaction that, when unbalanced, can cause a change in an object's velocity.<br/>D. A property inherent to all matter with mass.<br/>Answer: C. An interaction that, when unbalanced, can cause a change in an object's velocity.<br/>Explanation: Forces are interactions; unbalanced forces cause net acceleration according to Newton's Second Law. Answer A defines inertia, B defines energy, and D defines gravity.<br/><br/>16b. Question text<br/>A stationary object on a table experiences a gravitational force downwards. According to the definition of a force, what other force MUST be present?<br/>A. Frictional force parallel to the table's surface.<br/>B. Normal force exerted by the table, opposing gravity.<br/>C. Applied force that initiated the object's initial motion.<br/>D. Tension force holding the table in place.<br/>Answer: B. Normal force exerted by the table, opposing gravity.<br/>Explanation: If the object remains stationary, the net force is zero, meaning the gravitational force must be balanced by an equal and opposite force. The normal force from the table provides this balance.<br/><br/>16c. Question text<br/>Which of the following scenarios definitively demonstrates the *absence* of a net force acting on an object?<br/>A. An object moving at a constant speed along a curved path.<br/>B. An object momentarily at rest at the highest point of its trajectory.<br/>C. An object accelerating uniformly in a straight line.<br/>D. An object moving at a constant velocity in a straight line.<br/>Answer: D. An object moving at a constant velocity in a straight line.<br/>Explanation: Constant velocity (zero acceleration) directly implies zero net force, according to Newton's First Law. Options A and C involve acceleration, and option B is only instantaneous. | 16a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between a force and the motion of an object according to Newton’s first law?<br/>A. A force is required to maintain an object’s constant velocity.<br/>B. A net force is necessary to change an object’s state of motion.<br/>C. Forces only affect objects that are initially at rest.<br/>D. The magnitude of a force determines the instantaneous velocity of an object.<br/>Answer: B. A net force is necessary to change an object’s state of motion.<br/>Explanation: Newton’s first law states that an object remains in uniform motion (or at rest) unless acted upon by a *net* external force; thus, a net force causes acceleration, not velocity itself.<br/><br/>16b. A book rests on a table. Which of the following statements correctly identifies the forces acting on the book in terms of their potential to cause acceleration?<br/>A. The normal force and gravitational force are an action-reaction pair, so they cancel and produce no acceleration.<br/>B. The normal force balances gravitational force, resulting in a net force of zero and thus no acceleration.<br/>C. The gravitational force is unopposed, so the book accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s².<br/>D. The table exerts an upward force greater than gravity, causing a brief acceleration before equilibrium.<br/>Answer: B. The normal force balances gravitational force, resulting in a net force of zero and thus no acceleration.<br/>Explanation: Equilibrium occurs when vector sums of forces are zero (ΣF = 0), meaning no *net* force exists to accelerate the book; the normal force is an independent contact force, not part of an action-reaction pair with gravity.<br/><br/>16c. Which scenario demonstrates a force that does *not* produce acceleration despite acting on an object?<br/>A. A satellite orbiting Earth at constant speed due to gravitational force.<br/>B. A car braking uniformly to a stop on a straight road.<br/>C. A charged particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field at constant speed.<br/>D. A spring compressing as a mass is placed on top of it.<br/>Answer: C. A charged particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field at constant speed.<br/>Explanation: Magnetic forces on moving charges are always perpendicular to velocity, providing centripetal force (changing *direction*) but no work or change in *speed*; thus, magnitude of velocity (and kinetic energy) remains constant. |
| 17 | Gravity is the attractive force between two objects as a result of their masses. | 17a. Which of the following best describes the fundamental cause of gravitational attraction between two objects?<br/>A. The presence of electric charges on the objects<br/>B. The interaction of their masses<br/>C. The temperature difference between the objects<br/>D. The volume of the objects<br/>Answer: B. The interaction of their masses<br/>Explanation: Gravity arises due to the masses of objects, not their charges, temperature, or volume; this is a core concept in classical mechanics.<br/><br/>17b. If the mass of one object is doubled while the mass of the other remains the same, how is the gravitational force between them affected?<br/>A. It becomes repulsive instead of attractive<br/>B. It decreases by half<br/>C. It increases, because gravitational force depends on mass<br/>D. It remains unchanged, as gravity is independent of mass<br/>Answer: C. It increases, because gravitational force depends on mass<br/>Explanation: Gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses involved; increasing either mass increases the force.<br/><br/>17c. Which scenario demonstrates the distinguishing feature of gravitational force compared to other fundamental forces?<br/>A. It acts only between electrically charged particles<br/>B. It can be both attractive and repulsive<br/>C. It acts universally between all objects with mass<br/>D. It is stronger than the electromagnetic force at the atomic scale<br/>Answer: C.

Electrostatic interactions at the interface of the surfaces<br/>C. Magnetic forces generated by moving charges<br/>D. Pressure differences between the objects<br/>Answer: B. Electrostatic interactions at the interface of the surfaces<br/>Explanation: Friction arises primarily from electrostatic forces between the microscopic contact points of two surfaces, not from gravity, magnetism, or pressure differences.<br/><br/>18b. Frictional force is most directly responsible for which of the following everyday phenomena?<br/>A. A ball accelerating down a frictionless incline<br/>B. A car coming to a stop when brakes are applied<br/>C. A satellite orbiting the Earth<br/>D. The buoyant force on a submerged object<br/>Answer: B. A car coming to a stop when brakes are applied<br/>Explanation: Friction between the car's brake pads and wheels (or discs) opposes the motion, causing the car to decelerate and stop.<br/><br/>18c. Which statement correctly distinguishes friction from other contact forces?<br/>A. Friction always acts in the direction of motion.<br/>B. Friction results from macroscopic deformation only.<br/>C. Friction opposes relative motion due to surface electrostatic interactions.<br/>D. Friction is independent of the nature of the surfaces in contact.<br/>Answer: C. Friction opposes relative motion due to surface electrostatic interactions.<br/>Explanation: Friction is unique among contact forces because it specifically opposes relative motion and arises from electrostatic interactions at the surfaces, unlike normal or tension forces. | 18a. Question text<br/>Which of the following best describes the fundamental origin of frictional forces between two solid surfaces?<br/>A. Gravitational attraction between the surfaces' constituent atoms.<br/>B. Nuclear strong forces between the surfaces' constituent atoms.<br/>C. Electrostatic interactions between the surfaces' constituent atoms.<br/>D. Magnetic dipole-dipole interactions between the surfaces' constituent atoms.<br/>Answer: C. Electrostatic interactions between the surfaces' constituent atoms.<br/>Explanation: Friction arises from the numerous attractive and repulsive electrostatic forces between the atoms and molecules making up the surfaces. Although the overall surface may appear smooth, on the atomic level, there are many points of contact and interaction. These electrostatic interactions resist the relative motion of the surfaces.<br/><br/>18b. Question text<br/>A wooden block is sliding down an inclined plane at a constant velocity. Which of the following statements is true regarding the forces acting on the block?<br/>A. The component of gravity down the plane is equal to the normal force.<br/>B. The component of gravity down the plane is equal to the force of kinetic friction.<br/>C. The normal force is equal to the force of kinetic friction.<br/>D. The block experiences no net force because it is moving at a constant velocity.<br/>Answer: B. The component of gravity down the plane is equal to the force of kinetic friction.<br/>Explanation: Since the block is moving at a constant velocity (i.e., no acceleration), the net force on the block must be zero. This means the force of kinetic friction opposing the motion must be equal in magnitude to the component of gravity acting down the inclined plane.<br/><br/>18c. Question text<br/>Increasing the surface area of contact between two solid objects will most likely affect the frictional force between them in which of the following ways?<br/>A.

Static friction<br/>D. Kinetic friction<br/>Answer: C. Static friction<br/>Explanation: Static friction is the force that counteracts the component of gravity parallel to the plane, preventing the block from sliding as long as the surfaces remain stationary relative to each other.<br/><br/>19c. Which scenario correctly identifies when static friction, rather than kinetic friction, is present?<br/>A. A hockey puck sliding across ice<br/>B. A car parked on a sloped driveway<br/>C. A sled moving down a snowy hill<br/>D. A coin spinning on a table<br/>Answer: B. A car parked on a sloped driveway<br/>Explanation: Static friction acts when there is no relative motion between the contacting surfaces, as with a stationary car on a slope, whereas kinetic friction applies to sliding objects. | - | 19a. Which of the following best describes the fundamental condition required for static friction to act between two surfaces in contact?<br/>A. The surfaces must be rough at the microscopic level to generate adhesive forces.<br/>B. The coefficient of static friction must exceed the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>C. There must be no relative motion between the two surfaces in contact.<br/>D. An external force must be applied parallel to the surfaces to initiate frictional resistance.<br/>Answer: C. There must be no relative motion between the two surfaces in contact.<br/>Explanation: Static friction arises specifically when two surfaces are in contact but not sliding past each other; it is the frictional force that prevents incipient motion, regardless of surface roughness or applied forces.<br/><br/>19b. A block rests on an inclined plane without sliding. If the angle of inclination is gradually increased, what determines the maximum static friction force just before slipping begins?<br/>A. The normal force multiplied by the coefficient of kinetic friction<br/>B. The component of gravitational force parallel to the plane<br/>C. The normal force multiplied by the coefficient of static friction<br/>D. The sum of all external forces acting perpendicular to the plane<br/>Answer: C. The normal force multiplied by the coefficient of static friction<br/>Explanation: The maximum static friction force is given by *fₘₐₓ = μₛN*, where *μₛ* is the coefficient of static friction and *N* is the normal force; this value represents the threshold before relative motion starts.<br/><br/>19c. Which scenario definitively indicates that static friction is acting between two objects?<br/>A. A box slows to a stop after being pushed across a warehouse floor.<br/>B. A ladder leans against a wall without slipping, even when a person climbs it.<br/>C. A hockey puck glides on ice with gradually decreasing velocity.<br/>D. A car’s tires skid on a wet road during sudden braking.<br/>Answer: B. A ladder leans against a wall without slipping, even when a person climbs it.<br/>Explanation: Static friction acts when there is no relative motion between surfaces (e.g., ladder and wall/floor); the other scenarios involve kinetic friction (A, C) or a transition to kinetic friction (D). |
| 20 | Kinetic friction exists between two objects that are in motion relative to each other. | 20a. Which of the following best describes the condition required for kinetic friction to act between two surfaces?<br/>A. The surfaces must be at rest relative to each other.<br/>B. The surfaces must be moving relative to each other.<br/>C. The surfaces must be accelerating together.<br/>D. The surfaces must be separated by a thin layer of fluid.<br/>Answer: B.

A block rests on a horizontal surface. Which scenario will result in kinetic friction acting on the block?<br/>A. The block remains stationary despite an applied force.<br/>B. The block is pushed and slides across the surface.<br/>C. The block is lifted vertically off the surface.<br/>D. The block is attached to a spring but does not move.<br/>Answer: B. The block is pushed and slides across the surface.<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction occurs when there is relative motion (sliding) between the block and the surface, not when the block is stationary or not in contact.<br/><br/>20c. Which statement correctly distinguishes kinetic friction from static friction?<br/>A. Kinetic friction prevents objects from starting to move.<br/>B. Kinetic friction acts when two surfaces are at rest relative to each other.<br/>C. Kinetic friction acts only when there is relative sliding motion between surfaces.<br/>D. Kinetic friction is always greater than static friction.<br/>Answer: C.

Magnetic dipole interactions between electrons in the sliding materials<br/>Answer: B. Adhesive bonding and deformation of surface asperities during relative motion<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction arises primarily from temporary adhesive bonds forming and breaking between microscopic surface irregularities (asperities) as they slide past one another, coupled with deformation of these features.<br/><br/>20b. A block slides across a rough table at constant velocity. If the normal force between the block and table suddenly doubles, what happens to the magnitude of the kinetic friction force?<br/>A. It remains unchanged because kinetic friction depends only on the coefficient of friction and normal force, which offsets the change<br/>B. It doubles proportionally with the normal force, as the kinetic friction force is directly dependent on it<br/>C. It decreases because the increased normal force reduces the contact area between asperities<br/>D. It becomes zero temporarily due to the sudden change in force distribution<br/>Answer: B. It doubles proportionally with the normal force, as the kinetic friction force is directly dependent on it<br/>Explanation: The kinetic friction force is given by *fₖ = μₖN*, where *N* is the normal force; thus, doubling *N* doubles *fₖ* assuming the coefficient of kinetic friction (*μₖ*) remains constant.<br/><br/>20c. Which scenario would result in the complete elimination of kinetic friction between two solid surfaces in relative motion?<br/>A. Polishing the surfaces to atomic-level smoothness in a vacuum<br/>B. Lubricating the interface with a thin layer of viscous fluid<br/>C. Applying a normal force perpendicular to the direction of motion<br/>D. Increasing the relative velocity between the surfaces above a critical threshold<br/>Answer: A. Polishing the surfaces to atomic-level smoothness in a vacuum<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction requires surface asperities and adhesive interactions; atomic-scale smoothness in a vacuum (eliminating adhesive forces from contaminants or air) would theoretically remove kinetic friction, though this is idealized and practically unachievable in macroscopic systems. |
| 21 | Whereas static friction can take on many values depending on the magnitude of an applied force, kinetic friction is a constant value. | 21a. Which of the following best describes the difference between static and kinetic friction?<br/>A. Static friction always equals the maximum possible frictional force.<br/>B. Kinetic friction varies with the magnitude of the applied force.<br/>C. Static friction can adjust to match the applied force up to a maximum value, while kinetic friction remains constant once motion begins.<br/>D. Kinetic friction is always greater than static friction.<br/>Answer: C. Static friction can adjust to match the applied force up to a maximum value, while kinetic friction remains constant once motion begins.<br/>Explanation: Static friction resists initial motion by matching the applied force up to a threshold; kinetic friction acts with a constant magnitude once motion has started.<br/><br/>21b. A student pushes a box, increasing the applied force until the box just begins to move. Which statement correctly describes the frictional forces before and after motion begins?<br/>A. Kinetic friction increases as the box speeds up.<br/>B. Static friction decreases as the applied force increases.<br/>C. Static friction matches the applied force until motion starts, then kinetic friction acts at a constant value.<br/>D. Kinetic friction varies depending on how hard the box is pushed.<br/>Answer: C. Static friction matches the applied force until motion starts, then kinetic friction acts at a constant value.<br/>Explanation: Before motion, static friction balances the applied force up to its maximum; after motion begins, kinetic friction is constant regardless of the applied force.<br/><br/>21c. Which scenario demonstrates the unique property of kinetic friction compared to static friction?<br/>A. A stationary book resists sliding as you gradually increase your push.<br/>B. A sled moves at a constant speed across ice despite increasing force.<br/>C. A block remains at rest because friction cannot match the applied force.<br/>D. A car tire spins on ice without moving forward.<br/>Answer: B. A sled moves at a constant speed across ice despite increasing force.<br/>Explanation: Kinetic friction remains constant regardless of increasing applied force, unlike static friction, which varies up to its maximum; thus, the sled’s constant-speed motion despite varying push illustrates this property. | - | 21a. Which of the following best explains why static friction is described as having a range of possible values while kinetic friction is treated as a single value?<br/>A. Static friction depends on the normal force, whereas kinetic friction depends on the coefficient of friction alone.<br/>B. Static friction adjusts to match the applied force up to its maximum, while kinetic friction opposes motion at a fixed proportion of the normal force.<br/>C. Kinetic friction varies with velocity, whereas static friction remains constant regardless of the applied force.<br/>D. The coefficient of static friction is inherently variable, but the coefficient of kinetic friction is derived from material properties and is thus fixed.<br/>Answer: B. Static friction adjusts to match the applied force up to its maximum, while kinetic friction opposes motion at a fixed proportion of the normal force.<br/>Explanation: Static friction is a self-adjusting force that balances applied forces until its maximum (μₛN) is reached, whereas kinetic friction is a constant force (μₖN) acting opposite the direction of motion once sliding begins.<br/><br/>21b. A block remains stationary on an inclined plane despite an increasing angle of inclination. Which statement correctly describes the static friction force as the angle increases?<br/>A. The static friction force decreases because the component of gravitational force parallel to the plane increases.<br/>B. The static friction force remains constant because the coefficient of static friction is independent of the angle.<br/>C. The static friction force increases to match the increasing component of gravitational force until it reaches its maximum value.<br/>D. The static friction force fluctuates randomly as the angle changes due to microscopic surface interactions.<br/>Answer: C. The static friction force increases to match the increasing component of gravitational force until it reaches its maximum value.<br/>Explanation: Static friction is a responsive force that equals the net applied force (here, the parallel component of gravity) until it hits its limit (μₛN), at which point the block begins to slide.<br/><br/>21c. Which scenario demonstrates the key distinction between static and kinetic friction as described in the point?<br/>A. A crate requires a larger initial push to start moving than to keep it sliding at constant speed.<br/>B. A car’s tires lock during braking, causing the stopping distance to decrease due to reduced friction.<br/>C. A book slides down a ramp at constant velocity, meaning the net force on it is zero.<br/>D. A person struggles to push a heavy box but finds it easier to pull it using a rope at an angle.<br/>Answer: A. A crate requires a larger initial push to start moving than to keep it sliding at constant speed.<br/>Explanation: This illustrates that static friction’s *maximum* value (to initiate motion) exceeds kinetic friction’s *constant* value (to sustain motion), highlighting their distinct behavioral differences. |
| 22 | The coefficient of friction depends on the two materials in contact. The coefficient of static friction is always higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. | 22a. Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the coefficient of static friction and the coefficient of kinetic friction for a given pair of materials?<br/>A. The coefficient of static friction is always less than the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>B. The coefficient of static friction is always equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>C. The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>D. The coefficients of friction are unrelated to each other.<br/>Answer: C. The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.<br/>Explanation: For any two materials in contact, the coefficient of static friction exceeds that of kinetic friction, reflecting the greater force required to initiate motion compared to maintaining it.<br/><br/>22b. A block rests on a wooden table. Which change would most likely increase the coefficient of friction between the block and the table?<br/>A. Replacing the wooden block with a rubber block<br/>B. Increasing the mass of the block<br/>C. Increasing the surface area of contact<br/>D. Pushing the block faster across the table<br/>Answer: A. Replacing the wooden block with a rubber block<br/>Explanation: The coefficient of friction depends on the nature of the materials in contact; rubber generally has a higher coefficient of friction with wood than wood does with wood.<br/><br/>22c. Why is it generally more difficult to initiate the motion of a stationary object than to keep it moving at constant speed?<br/>A. Because kinetic friction is always greater than static friction<br/>B. Because static friction is always greater than kinetic friction<br/>C. Because friction does not depend on the materials in contact<br/>D. Because friction increases with speed<br/>Answer: B. Because static friction is always greater than kinetic friction<br/>Explanation: The maximum static frictional force exceeds the kinetic frictional force, so more force is required to overcome static friction and start motion than to maintain motion. | - | 22a. Which of the following statements best explains why an astronaut’s weight on the Moon is less than on Earth, while their mass remains unchanged?<br/>A. The Moon’s weaker gravitational field reduces the astronaut’s inertia, thereby decreasing mass.<br/>B. Weight depends on gravitational acceleration, which is lower on the Moon, whereas mass is an intrinsic property.<br/>C. The astronaut’s volume decreases on the Moon, altering the distribution of mass but not its total quantity.<br/>D. Mass is conserved only in inertial reference frames, and the Moon’s motion invalidates this conservation.<br/>Answer: B. Weight depends on gravitational acceleration, which is lower on the Moon, whereas mass is an intrinsic property.<br/>Explanation: Weight (W = mg) varies with gravitational field strength (g), but mass—a measure of inertia—is invariant regardless of location, as it is independent of external forces.<br/><br/>22b. A spring scale measures an object’s weight in newtons on Earth. If the same object is measured on a planet with half the gravitational acceleration of Earth, which quantity remains directly readable on the scale?<br/>A. Mass, because the scale’s calibration accounts for local gravitational differences.<br/>B. Weight, but the numerical value will be halved due to reduced gravitational force.<br/>C. Density, since the ratio of mass to volume is unaffected by gravity.<br/>D. Inertia, as the object’s resistance to acceleration is independent of the scale’s mechanism.<br/>Answer: B. Weight, but the numerical value will be halved due to reduced gravitational force.<br/>Explanation: A spring scale measures weight (force due to gravity), which scales with g; mass and inertia are not directly measured by the scale, and density is unrelated to gravitational effects.<br/><br/>22c. Which scenario demonstrates a conceptual misunderstanding of the distinction between mass and weight?<br/>A. A student calculates an object’s mass using a balance scale by comparing it to known standards.<br/>B. An engineer designs a bridge support assuming the weight of vehicles depends on local gravitational acceleration.<br/>C. A lab technician reports an object’s “mass” in kilograms-newtons (kg·N) after using a spring scale in a high-altitude lab.<br/>D. A physicist uses the equation F = ma to predict an object’s acceleration under a known net force.<br/>Answer: C. A lab technician reports an object’s “mass” in kilograms-newtons (kg·N) after using a spring scale in a high-altitude lab.<br/>Explanation: Spring scales measure weight (force, in newtons), not mass (kilograms); conflating the units or labeling the reading as “mass” reflects a failure to distinguish between the two quantities. |

Mass is a measure of inertia, while weight is a measure of gravitational force.<br/>B. Mass changes depending on location, while weight remains constant.<br/>C. Mass is measured in newtons, while weight is measured in kilograms.<br/>D. Mass and weight are both scalar quantities.<br/>Answer: A. Mass is a measure of inertia, while weight is a measure of gravitational force.<br/>Explanation: Mass is an intrinsic property of matter reflecting its resistance to acceleration (inertia), whereas weight is the force exerted on that mass by gravity.<br/><br/>23b. An astronaut travels from Earth to the Moon. Which of the following statements is true regarding the astronaut’s mass and weight?<br/>A. Both mass and weight decrease.<br/>B. Mass decreases, but weight remains the same.<br/>C. Mass remains the same, but weight decreases.<br/>D. Both mass and weight remain the same.<br/>Answer: C. Mass remains the same, but weight decreases.<br/>Explanation: Mass is invariant regardless of location, but weight decreases on the Moon due to its lower gravitational acceleration.<br/><br/>23c. A student claims that a 5-kg object on Earth has a weight of 5 kg. What is incorrect about this statement?<br/>A. The object’s mass is not 5 kg.<br/>B. The object’s weight should be expressed in newtons, not kilograms.<br/>C. The object’s mass and weight are always numerically equal.<br/>D. The object has zero weight in all locations.<br/>Answer: B. The object’s weight should be expressed in newtons, not kilograms.<br/>Explanation: Mass is measured in kilograms, but weight is a force and should be expressed in newtons; confusing the units conflates the two concepts. | - | 23a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between mass and inertia?<br/>A. Mass is the gravitational force acting on an object, while inertia is the object’s resistance to changes in motion.<br/>B. Mass and inertia are inversely proportional: objects with greater mass exhibit less inertia.<br/>C. Mass is a quantitative measure of an object’s inertia, reflecting its resistance to acceleration.<br/>D. Inertia is a force that acts on an object, whereas mass is a property that determines the strength of that force.<br/>Answer: C. Mass is a quantitative measure of an object’s inertia, reflecting its resistance to acceleration.<br/>Explanation: Inertia is an object’s resistance to changes in its state of motion, and mass is the scalar quantity that directly quantifies this property, as described by Newton’s first and second laws.<br/><br/>23b. A block of mass *m* is placed on a frictionless horizontal surface. If an identical block of mass *m* is placed on top of it and the two blocks are moved together, how does the inertia of the system change?<br/>A. The inertia doubles because the total mass increases, requiring twice the force for the same acceleration.<br/>B. The inertia remains unchanged because the blocks are in contact and move as a single unit.<br/>C. The inertia decreases due to the distribution of mass over a larger area.<br/>D. The inertia becomes undefined because the system’s center of mass shifts vertically.<br/>Answer: A. The inertia doubles because the total mass increases, requiring twice the force for the same acceleration.<br/>Explanation: Inertia is directly proportional to mass. Doubling the mass (while keeping other factors constant) doubles the system’s resistance to acceleration, as per *F = ma*.<br/><br/>23c. Which scenario demonstrates that mass is the property determining an object’s inertia?<br/>A. A feather and a bowling ball fall at the same rate in a vacuum, showing that gravity affects all objects equally.<br/>B. A pushed shopping cart requires more force to accelerate when loaded with groceries than when empty.<br/>C. A magnet attracts a paperclip but not a wooden block, illustrating differences in material composition.<br/>D. A car’s tires grip the road better on dry pavement than on ice, highlighting the role of friction.<br/>Answer: B. A pushed shopping cart requires more force to accelerate when loaded with groceries than when empty.<br/>Explanation: The increased mass of the loaded cart results in greater inertia, requiring more force for the same acceleration (*F = ma*), directly illustrating mass as the measure of inertia. |

The amount of space an object occupies<br/>B. The resistance of an object to changes in its motion<br/>C. The energy an object possesses due to its position<br/>D. The force an object exerts due to gravity<br/>Answer: B. The resistance of an object to changes in its motion<br/>Explanation: Mass quantifies an object's inertia, which is its resistance to acceleration when a force is applied.<br/><br/>24b. If two objects have the same volume but different masses, what can be inferred about their inertial properties?<br/>A. They have the same inertia because their volumes are equal<br/>B. The object with greater mass has more inertia<br/>C. The object with smaller mass has more inertia<br/>D. Both have equal inertia if their shapes are identical<br/>Answer: B. The object with greater mass has more inertia<br/>Explanation: Inertia depends solely on mass, not volume or shape; greater mass means greater resistance to changes in motion.<br/><br/>24c. Which statement correctly distinguishes mass from weight in terms of physical meaning?<br/>A. Mass is dependent on gravity, while weight is not<br/>B. Mass measures inertia, while weight measures gravitational force<br/>C. Mass changes with location, but weight does not<br/>D. Mass and weight are identical physical quantities<br/>Answer: B. Mass measures inertia, while weight measures gravitational force<br/>Explanation: Mass is a measure of the amount of matter and inertia, whereas weight is the force due to gravity acting on that mass. | 24a. A spacecraft far from any gravitational sources fires its engines to increase its velocity. Which of the following properties of the spacecraft most directly relates to the difficulty in changing its velocity?<br/>A. Volume<br/>B. Mass<br/>C. Weight<br/>D. Surface Area<br/>Answer: B. Mass<br/>Explanation: Inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its state of motion. Mass is a direct measure of an object's inertia; greater mass means greater resistance to acceleration.<br/><br/>24b. Two objects, one with a larger mass and one with a smaller mass, are subjected to the same net force. Which statement best describes their resulting accelerations?<br/>A. Both objects will experience the same acceleration.<br/>B. The object with the larger mass will experience a smaller acceleration.<br/>C. The object with the smaller mass will experience a smaller acceleration.<br/>D. The object with the larger mass will experience a larger acceleration.<br/>Answer: B. The object with the larger mass will experience a smaller acceleration.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law (F = ma) shows that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass when force is constant. Higher mass leads to less acceleration for the same applied force, demonstrating inertia.<br/><br/>24c. An astronaut in the International Space Station experiences apparent weightlessness. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the astronaut's mass?<br/>A. The astronaut's mass is zero because they are weightless.<br/>B. The astronaut's mass is significantly reduced but not zero.<br/>C. The astronaut's mass is the same as it would be on Earth.<br/>D. The astronaut's mass is immeasurable in a weightless environment.<br/>Answer: C. The astronaut's mass is the same as it would be on Earth.<br/>Explanation: Mass is an intrinsic property representing the amount of matter, independent of gravitational force or weight. Weightlessness affects the sensation of weight, not the amount of matter present. | 24a. Which of the following best defines weight in terms of fundamental physical quantities?<br/>A. The intrinsic resistance of an object to changes in its motion<br/>B. The gravitational force exerted on an object by a celestial body<br/>C. The total mass of an object measured in a vacuum<br/>D. The upward buoyant force counteracting an object’s mass<br/>Answer: B. The gravitational force exerted on an object by a celestial body<br/>Explanation: Weight is specifically the force due to gravity acting on a mass, distinct from inertia (A), mass itself (C), or buoyant forces (D), which are context-dependent.<br/><br/>24b. A student claims that an astronaut’s weight on the Moon is less than on Earth because the Moon’s gravitational acceleration is weaker. Which principle does this observation illustrate?<br/>A. Conservation of mass<br/>B. Inverse-square law of gravitation<br/>C. Dependence of weight on local gravitational field strength<br/>D. Relativistic effects on mass at different altitudes<br/>Answer: C. Dependence of weight on local gravitational field strength<br/>Explanation: Weight (F = mg) varies with gravitational acceleration (g), which differs between celestial bodies; this is unrelated to mass conservation (A), the inverse-square law’s mathematical form (B), or relativity (D).<br/><br/>24c. If an object is placed on a scale inside an elevator accelerating upward, how does the scale reading compare to the object’s weight at rest on Earth’s surface?<br/>A. It reads less because apparent weight decreases during acceleration.<br/>B. It reads the same because mass is invariant under acceleration.<br/>C. It reads more because the scale measures the normal force, which exceeds gravitational force.<br/>D. It reads zero because the object is in free-fall relative to the elevator.<br/>Answer: C. It reads more because the scale measures the normal force, which exceeds gravitational force.<br/>Explanation: In upward acceleration, the normal force (scale reading) must counteract both gravity and provide the net force for acceleration, resulting in an apparent weight greater than the true weight (mg). |
| 25 | Weight is the force experienced by a given mass due to its gravitational attraction to the Earth. | 25a. Which of the following best describes the physical concept of "weight" as experienced by an object on Earth?<br/>A. The amount of matter contained within an object<br/>B. The force exerted by gravity on a given mass<br/>C. The resistance of an object to acceleration<br/>D. The energy required to lift an object<br/>Answer: B. The force exerted by gravity on a given mass<br/>Explanation: Weight is defined as the gravitational force acting on a mass due to Earth's gravity, distinguishing it from mass, inertia, or energy.<br/><br/>25b.

The object's mass<br/>D. The object's acceleration due to gravity<br/>Answer: C. The object's mass<br/>Explanation: Mass is an intrinsic property and does not depend on location, while weight and gravitational force depend on the local gravitational field.<br/><br/>25c. Which scenario correctly illustrates the difference between mass and weight?<br/>A. A 5 kg rock has the same weight on Earth and Mars<br/>B. A 5 kg rock has the same mass on Earth and Mars, but different weights<br/>C. A 5 kg rock has different masses on Earth and Mars, but the same weight<br/>D. A 5 kg rock's mass and weight both change when moved from Earth to Mars<br/>Answer: B. A 5 kg rock has the same mass on Earth and Mars, but different weights<br/>Explanation: Mass remains constant regardless of location, but weight varies because it depends on the local gravitational acceleration. | 25a. Which of the following scenarios would result in the greatest decrease in an object's weight?<br/>A. Moving the object from sea level to a mountaintop.<br/>B. Submerging the object completely in water.<br/>C. Placing the object in a freely falling elevator.<br/>D. Charging the object with a large positive electrostatic charge.<br/>Answer: C. Placing the object in a freely falling elevator.<br/>Explanation: Weight is the force of gravity on an object. In a freely falling elevator, the object experiences apparent weightlessness because the gravitational force is the only force acting on it in the non-inertial reference frame. The other options affect either the gravitational force minutely or introduce other forces besides gravity.<br/><br/>25b. An astronaut is orbiting the Earth in the space station. Which of the following statements best describes the astronaut's weight?<br/>A. The astronaut's weight is equal to their mass multiplied by the Earth's gravitational acceleration at that altitude.<br/>B. The astronaut's weight is zero because there is no gravity in space.<br/>C. The astronaut's weight is nearly equal to their weight on Earth.<br/>D. The astronaut's weight is dependent on the speed of the space station.<br/>Answer: A. The astronaut's weight is equal to their mass multiplied by the Earth's gravitational acceleration at that altitude.<br/>Explanation: Weight is the force due to gravity. Even in orbit, the astronaut experiences Earth's gravitational pull. Weight is still defined as mg, where g is the local gravitational acceleration, even in orbit. The astronaut experiences weightlessness because the space station is in freefall.<br/><br/>25c. Which of the following forces directly contributes to the measured weight of an object resting on a bathroom scale at sea level?<br/>A. The buoyant force exerted by the atmosphere.<br/>B. The electromagnetic force between the scale and the object.<br/>C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the object.<br/>D. The normal force exerted by the scale on the object.<br/>Answer: C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the object.<br/>Explanation: Weight is defined as the force of gravity on an object. The scale measures the force the object exerts due to gravity, which is then interpreted as the object's weight. The normal force is equal and opposite to the object's apparent weight (accounting for buoyancy if it were present). | 25a. Which of the following statements correctly distinguishes average acceleration from instantaneous acceleration?<br/>A. Average acceleration is a scalar quantity, while instantaneous acceleration is always a vector.<br/>B. Average acceleration is calculated over a finite time interval, while instantaneous acceleration is the limit as the time interval approaches zero.<br/>C. Instantaneous acceleration can only be determined graphically, while average acceleration requires algebraic manipulation.<br/>D. Average acceleration depends on displacement, while instantaneous acceleration depends on velocity.<br/><br/>25b. A car’s speedometer reads 20 m/s at t = 2 s and 30 m/s at t = 4 s. If the car moves in a straight line, which of the following must be true about its acceleration during this interval?<br/>A. The acceleration vector points in the same direction as the velocity vector if speed is increasing.<br/>B. The acceleration is zero because the change in velocity is linear over time.<br/>C. The acceleration is constant only if the car’s direction remains unchanged.<br/>D. The magnitude of acceleration equals the change in speed divided by the change in time, regardless of direction.<br/><br/>25c. Which scenario demonstrates a nonzero instantaneous acceleration at a specific moment in time?<br/>A. A ball rolling at constant velocity along a frictionless horizontal surface.<br/>B. A satellite moving in a circular orbit at constant speed.<br/>C. A projectile at the peak of its trajectory in the absence of air resistance.<br/>D.

A satellite moving at constant speed in a circular orbit<br/>D. A ball at rest on the ground<br/>Answer: C. A satellite moving at constant speed in a circular orbit<br/>Explanation: Acceleration involves any change in velocity, including changes in direction; thus, uniform circular motion involves acceleration even at constant speed.<br/><br/>26c. Which statement accurately distinguishes between average and instantaneous acceleration?<br/>A. Average acceleration is always equal to instantaneous acceleration<br/>B. Instantaneous acceleration considers the change in velocity over an extended time interval<br/>C. Average acceleration refers to the change in velocity over a specific time period, while instantaneous acceleration refers to the change at a particular moment<br/>D. Both average and instantaneous acceleration ignore the direction of velocity<br/>Answer: C. Average acceleration refers to the change in velocity over a specific time period, while instantaneous acceleration refers to the change at a particular moment<br/>Explanation: Average acceleration is measured over a finite interval, while instantaneous acceleration is the value at a specific instant, reflecting the difference in how they capture changes in velocity. | 26a.

The car experienced a constant velocity during the 4 seconds.<br/>B. The car experienced a change in velocity during the 4 seconds.<br/>C. The car's displacement remained constant during the 4 seconds.<br/>D. The car's kinetic energy remained constant during the 4 seconds.<br/>Answer: B. The car experienced a change in velocity during the 4 seconds.<br/>Explanation: Acceleration, by definition, is the change in velocity over time. Since the car's velocity increased, it experienced acceleration.<br/><br/>26b. A projectile is launched horizontally from a cliff. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following quantities remains constant during the projectile's flight?<br/>A. Vertical component of velocity<br/>B. Horizontal component of velocity<br/>C. Magnitude of the net force acting on the projectile<br/>D. Magnitude of the acceleration vector of the projectile<br/>Answer: D. Magnitude of the acceleration vector of the projectile<br/>Explanation: Since only gravity acts on the projectile, the acceleration is constant and equal to 'g' downwards, which is the acceleration due to gravity. The horizontal velocity is constant, but the question asked specifically about acceleration. The net force also remains constant.<br/><br/>26c. Which of the following scenarios demonstrates an object experiencing zero acceleration?<br/>A. A car traveling around a circular track at a constant speed.<br/>B. A pendulum swinging back and forth.<br/>C. A skydiver falling at terminal velocity.<br/>D. A ball thrown upwards that is momentarily at rest at its peak height.<br/>Answer: C. A skydiver falling at terminal velocity.<br/>Explanation: Terminal velocity indicates constant velocity, which implies zero acceleration. Circular motion always has centripetal acceleration, and the pendulum and the ball are both changing velocity. | 26a. Which of the following best describes the physical quantity that Newton’s first law defines implicitly?<br/><br/>26b. A hockey puck slides at constant speed across frictionless ice. If a player exerts a brief horizontal force on the puck in the direction of motion, which statement about the puck’s behavior immediately *after* the force is removed is consistent with Newton’s first law?<br/><br/>26c. Which scenario violates the principles of Newton’s first law? |
| 27 | Newton's first law, or the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or move with a constant velocity if there is no net force on the object. | 27a. Which of the following best describes the principle stated by Newton's first law of motion?<br/>A. An object will accelerate unless acted upon by a net force.<br/>B. An object will remain at rest or move at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.<br/>C. An object will always move in a straight line regardless of forces.<br/>D. An object will decrease its velocity unless a force maintains it.<br/>Answer: B. An object will remain at rest or move at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's first law states that in the absence of a net force, an object's state of motion will not change; it will either remain at rest or continue moving at a constant velocity.<br/><br/>27b. A hockey puck slides across perfectly smooth, frictionless ice. According to Newton's first law, what will happen to the puck if no external forces act on it?<br/>A. It will gradually slow down and stop.<br/>B. It will continue moving at a constant speed in a straight line.<br/>C. It will curve due to its inertia.<br/>D. It will accelerate in the direction of motion.<br/>Answer: B. It will continue moving at a constant speed in a straight line.<br/>Explanation: Without external forces such as friction, Newton's first law predicts the puck will maintain its velocity (both speed and direction), illustrating inertia.<br/><br/>27c. Which scenario demonstrates a violation of Newton's first law?<br/>A. A stationary box remains at rest on a frictionless surface.<br/>B. A car moving at constant velocity suddenly slows down without any apparent force.<br/>C. A satellite orbits Earth at constant speed in a circular path.<br/>D. A dropped ball accelerates downward due to gravity.<br/>Answer: B. A car moving at constant velocity suddenly slows down without any apparent force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's first law requires a net force for a change in velocity; a car slowing down without any force contradicts the law, as velocity changes only in response to net forces. | 27a. A spaceship is drifting in deep space with its engines off. Which of the following best describes the motion of the spaceship?<br/>A. It will eventually slow down and stop due to the lack of propulsion.<br/>B. It will continue to move at a constant velocity indefinitely unless acted upon by a net external force.<br/>C. It will accelerate due to the absence of friction.<br/>D. It will randomly change its direction of motion.<br/>Answer: B. It will continue to move at a constant velocity indefinitely unless acted upon by a net external force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's first law states that an object in motion will stay in motion with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force. Deep space has negligible external forces, so the spaceship's velocity will remain constant.<br/><br/>27b. Which of the following situations best exemplifies the principle of inertia?<br/>A. A car accelerating from rest.<br/>B. A ball rolling on a flat, level surface maintaining a constant speed.<br/>C. A skydiver experiencing air resistance.<br/>D. A rocket launching into space with constant thrust.<br/>Answer: B. A ball rolling on a flat, level surface maintaining a constant speed.<br/>Explanation: Inertia describes an object's tendency to resist changes in its state of motion. A ball rolling at a constant speed on a level surface is an example of inertia since it maintains a constant velocity when no net force acts upon it.<br/><br/>27c. Which of the following is the MOST fundamental consequence of Newton's First Law?<br/>A. Objects require a force to maintain a constant velocity.<br/>B. Acceleration is always proportional to an applied force.<br/>C. A net force is required to change an object's state of motion.<br/>D. Gravity is a force that acts on all objects with mass.<br/>Answer: C. A net force is required to change an object's state of motion.<br/>Explanation: Newton's First Law essentially says that without a net force, an object will maintain its current state of motion, whether at rest or moving at a constant velocity. Therefore, a force is fundamentally required to *change* that state of motion. | 27a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between net force, mass, and acceleration as defined by Newton’s second law?<br/>A. Acceleration is directly proportional to mass and inversely proportional to net force.<br/>B. Acceleration is directly proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass.<br/>C. Net force is the product of mass and the square of acceleration.<br/>D. Mass is the ratio of acceleration to the net force acting on the object.<br/>Answer: B. Acceleration is directly proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass.<br/>Explanation: Newton’s second law is expressed as **Fₙₑₜ = ma**, meaning acceleration (**a**) scales with net force (**Fₙₑₜ**) and inversely with mass (**m**), a foundational concept for dynamics in MCAT physics.<br/><br/>27b. A block on a frictionless surface is acted upon by two horizontal forces of unequal magnitude in opposite directions. If the block’s mass doubles while the forces remain constant, how does its acceleration change?<br/>A. It doubles.<br/>B. It halves.<br/>C. It remains unchanged.<br/>D. It becomes zero.<br/>Answer: B. It halves.<br/>Explanation: Since **a = Fₙₑₜ/m**, doubling the mass (**m**) while keeping net force (**Fₙₑₜ**) constant reduces acceleration by half, demonstrating the inverse relationship between mass and acceleration.<br/><br/>27c. Which scenario violates Newton’s second law?<br/>A. A car maintains constant velocity on a straight road with zero net force.<br/>B. A rocket accelerates upward as its mass decreases due to fuel consumption.<br/>C. A box slides at constant speed across a rough surface with balanced forces.<br/>D. A falling object’s acceleration increases as its mass increases, assuming air resistance is negligible.<br/>Answer: D. A falling object’s acceleration increases as its mass increases, assuming air resistance is negligible.<br/>Explanation: Newton’s second law states **a = Fₙₑₜ/m**; for free fall, **Fₙₑₜ = mg**, so **a = g** (constant) regardless of mass. Acceleration cannot increase with mass under constant net force, making this scenario impossible. |
| 28 | Newton's second law states that any acceleration is the result of the sum of the forces acting on the object and its mass. | 28a. Which of the following best describes the relationship expressed by Newton's second law of motion?<br/>A. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the sum of the forces acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>B. The net force on an object is always equal to its velocity times its mass.<br/>C. The acceleration of an object is always in the opposite direction of the net force.<br/>D. The sum of the forces on an object is always zero if the object is moving.<br/>Answer: A. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the sum of the forces acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law states that net force equals mass times acceleration, indicating acceleration depends on both net force and mass.<br/><br/>28b. A student observes an object at rest that suddenly begins to accelerate. According to Newton's second law, which of the following must have occurred?<br/>A. The mass of the object decreased.<br/>B. A net external force began acting on the object.<br/>C. The object's inertia changed spontaneously.<br/>D. The object’s velocity became constant.<br/>Answer: B. A net external force began acting on the object.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law requires a net force to cause acceleration; acceleration cannot occur without a net external force.<br/><br/>28c. Which scenario violates Newton's second law as stated in classical mechanics?<br/>A. A car maintains constant velocity while the net force on it is zero.<br/>B. An object accelerates in the absence of any net external force.<br/>C. A ball at rest remains at rest when no forces act on it.<br/>D. A block slows down due to friction acting opposite its motion.<br/>Answer: B. An object accelerates in the absence of any net external force.<br/>Explanation: Newton's second law dictates that acceleration only results from a net force; acceleration without a net force is not possible. | 28a. Question text<br/>Which of the following statements best encapsulates Newton's second law?<br/>A. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net external force.<br/>B. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>C. The net force acting on an object is directly proportional to the object's acceleration and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>D. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed.<br/>Answer: C. The net force acting on an object is directly proportional to the object's acceleration and inversely proportional to its mass.<br/>Explanation: Newton's Second Law directly relates net force, mass, and acceleration. The relationship shows that a greater force or a smaller mass will result in greater acceleration. Choices A, B, and D describe Newton's First Law, Newton's Third Law, and the Law of Conservation of Energy, respectively.<br/><br/>28b. Question text<br/>A block of mass *m* slides across a frictionless horizontal surface with constant velocity. Which of the following statements concerning the net force on the block is correct?<br/>A. The net force is directed along the direction of motion.<br/>B. The net force is directed opposite to the direction of motion.<br/>C. The net force is zero.<br/>D. The net force is increasing over time.<br/>Answer: C. The net force is zero.<br/>Explanation: Newton's Second Law states that acceleration is proportional to net force. Since the velocity is constant, acceleration is zero, and therefore the net force must also be zero, regardless of any individual forces that may be present.<br/><br/>28c. Question text<br/>Two objects, one with mass *m* and another with mass 2*m*, are subjected to the same net force. How do their accelerations compare?<br/>A. The object with mass *m* experiences twice the acceleration of the object with mass 2*m*.<br/>B. The object with mass 2*m* experiences twice the acceleration of the object with mass *m*.<br/>C. Both objects experience the same acceleration.<br/>D. The object with mass *m* experiences four times the acceleration of the object with mass 2*m*.<br/>Answer: A. The object with mass *m* experiences twice the acceleration of the object with mass 2*m*.<br/>Explanation: According to Newton's second law, *a* = *F*/ *m*. If the net force, *F*, is the same for both objects, the object with half the mass will have twice the acceleration. | 28a. When a swimmer pushes backward against the water with their arms, what is the origin of the forward force that propels them through the pool?<br/><br/>28b. A physics student claims that when a book rests on a table, the upward force by the table (normal force) and the downward force of gravity on the book are a third-law pair. Which of the following best explains why this claim is incorrect?<br/><br/>28c. Two ice skaters, initially at rest, push off each other and move in opposite directions. If Skater A has twice the mass of Skater B, which of the following correctly describes the relationship between the forces they exert on each other during the push? |
| 29 | Newton's third law states that any two objects interacting with one another experience equal and opposite forces as a result of their interaction. | 29a. Which of the following best describes Newton's third law of motion?<br/>A. The net force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration.<br/>B. An object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by an external force.<br/>C. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>D. The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.<br/>Answer: C. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law states that forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs between interacting objects.<br/><br/>29b. When a bat strikes a baseball, which statement correctly applies Newton's third law?<br/>A. The bat exerts a greater force on the ball than the ball exerts on the bat.<br/>B. The ball exerts a greater force on the bat than the bat exerts on the ball.<br/>C. The bat and the ball exert equal and opposite forces on each other.<br/>D. Only the bat exerts a force during the collision.<br/>Answer: C. The bat and the ball exert equal and opposite forces on each other.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law requires that the force the bat exerts on the ball is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force the ball exerts on the bat.<br/><br/>29c. Which scenario does NOT illustrate Newton’s third law?<br/>A. A swimmer pushes water backward and moves forward.<br/>B. A rocket expels exhaust gases downward and lifts off upward.<br/>C. A car accelerates due to friction between its tires and the road.<br/>D. A ball rolling on a flat surface eventually comes to rest due to friction.<br/>Answer: D. A ball rolling on a flat surface eventually comes to rest due to friction.<br/>Explanation: Option D describes a process involving friction and energy dissipation, not a pair of equal and opposite interaction forces as specified by Newton’s third law. | 29a. Question text<br/>A satellite orbits the Earth. Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth?<br/>A. The Earth exerts a significantly greater gravitational force on the satellite.<br/>B. The satellite exerts a significantly greater gravitational force on the Earth.<br/>C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth are equal in magnitude.<br/>D. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth depend on the satellite's velocity.<br/>Answer: C. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the satellite and the gravitational force exerted by the satellite on the Earth are equal in magnitude.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law dictates that interacting objects exert equal and opposite forces on each other, regardless of mass differences. The gravitational force constitutes such an interaction, hence the forces are equal.<br/><br/>29b. Question text<br/>A car accelerates forward. What is the "reaction" force, as described by Newton's third law, to the force exerted by the tires on the road?<br/>A. The force exerted by the air resistance on the car.<br/>B. The force exerted by the car's engine to turn the tires.<br/>C. The force exerted by the road on the tires.<br/>D. The force exerted by the tires on the car.<br/>Answer: C. The force exerted by the road on the tires.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the tires push backward on the road (action), the road pushes forward on the tires (reaction), enabling the car's acceleration.<br/><br/>29c. Question text<br/>A person leans against a wall. Which of the following force pairs illustrates Newton's third law?<br/>A. The person's weight and the normal force from the ground.<br/>B. The force of the person on the wall and the force of the wall on the person.<br/>C. The person's weight and the upward force exerted by the person’s muscles.<br/>D. The force of friction between the person's shoes and the ground and the force of the wall on the person.<br/>Answer: B. The force of the person on the wall and the force of the wall on the person.<br/>Explanation: Newton's third law focuses on interacting pairs. The person applies a force *on the wall*, and the wall correspondingly applies an equal and opposite force *on the person*. | 29a. Which of the following best defines the condition for linear motion where velocity and acceleration are antiparallel?<br/>A. An object moving upward at constant speed in the absence of air resistance<br/>B. An object decelerating as it moves horizontally across a rough surface<br/>C. A projectile at the peak of its trajectory in free fall<br/>D. A car accelerating uniformly while traveling in reverse<br/>Answer: D. A car accelerating uniformly while traveling in reverse<br/>Explanation: Antiparallel vectors point in opposite directions; in this case, velocity (backward) and acceleration (also backward, if increasing speed in reverse) are aligned but opposite in sense to the conventional forward direction.<br/><br/>29b. A ball is thrown straight upward and then falls back to the ground. At which point during its flight are the velocity and acceleration vectors parallel?<br/>A. Only during the upward portion of the motion<br/>B. Only at the instant it reaches maximum height<br/>C. Only during the downward portion of the motion<br/>D. Both during the upward and downward portions of the motion<br/>Answer: C. Only during the downward portion of the motion<br/>Explanation: In free fall, acceleration (g) always points downward. Velocity is upward initially, zero at peak height, and downward afterward; thus, velocity and acceleration are parallel only when both point downward.<br/><br/>29c. Which scenario does NOT represent linear motion with velocity and acceleration vectors either parallel or antiparallel?<br/>A. A skydiver falling at terminal velocity before opening the parachute<br/>B. A train slowing to a stop with constant deceleration<br/>C. A planet orbiting the Sun in a circular path<br/>D. A stone dropped from rest in a vacuum<br/>Answer: C. A planet orbiting the Sun in a circular path<br/>Explanation: Circular motion involves centripetal acceleration perpendicular to velocity, whereas linear motion requires collinear vectors. The other options describe straight-line motion with parallel/antiparallel vectors. |
| 30 | Linear motion includes free fall and motion in which the velocity and acceleration vectors are parallel or antiparallel. | 30a. Which of the following scenarios best exemplifies linear motion as defined in kinematics?<br/>A. A car moving in a circular track at constant speed<br/>B. A stone dropped from a bridge into a river below<br/>C. A spinning ice skater pulling in her arms<br/>D. An electron moving in a magnetic field along a curved path<br/>Answer: B. A stone dropped from a bridge into a river below<br/>Explanation: Linear motion refers to motion along a straight line, including free fall, where velocity and acceleration are parallel or antiparallel.<br/><br/>30b. In linear motion, what is the relationship between the velocity and acceleration vectors?<br/>A. They are always perpendicular<br/>B. They are either parallel or antiparallel<br/>C. They are always in the same direction<br/>D. They are always in opposite directions<br/>Answer: B. They are either parallel or antiparallel<br/>Explanation: In linear motion, velocity and acceleration vectors are aligned along the same straight line, either in the same (parallel) or opposite (antiparallel) directions.<br/><br/>30c. Which of the following motions does NOT qualify as linear motion?<br/>A. A ball thrown vertically upward<br/>B. A block sliding down a frictionless incline in a straight path<br/>C. A satellite orbiting Earth in a circular path<br/>D. An elevator moving upward at constant acceleration<br/>Answer: C. A satellite orbiting Earth in a circular path<br/>Explanation: Linear motion requires movement along a straight line, whereas a satellite in orbit follows a curved (circular) path, so it is not linear motion. | 30a. A skydiver jumps from a plane. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following statements best describes the skydiver's acceleration immediately after jumping?<br/>A. The acceleration is constant and equal to zero.<br/>B. The acceleration is decreasing as the skydiver falls.<br/>C. The acceleration is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity.<br/>D. The acceleration is increasing as the skydiver falls.<br/>Answer: C. The acceleration is constant and equal to the acceleration due to gravity.<br/>Explanation: In free fall, the only force acting on the object (neglecting air resistance) is gravity, resulting in a constant downward acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s². This is independent of the object's velocity.<br/><br/>30b. Under what condition is the average velocity of an object undergoing linear motion equal to the average of its initial and final velocities?<br/>A. When the object is accelerating.<br/>B. When the object's acceleration is constant.<br/>C. When the object's displacement is zero.<br/>D. When the object is moving at a constant velocity.<br/>Answer: B. When the object's acceleration is constant.<br/>Explanation: The average velocity is equal to (vi + vf)/2 only when the acceleration is constant. This is a direct result of the kinematic equations derived under constant acceleration.<br/><br/>30c. A car travels along a straight road. Which of the following scenarios describes a situation where the car's velocity and acceleration vectors are antiparallel?<br/>A. The car is speeding up while moving forward.<br/>B. The car is slowing down while moving forward.<br/>C. The car is moving at a constant velocity.<br/>D. The car is stopped at a red light.<br/>Answer: B. The car is slowing down while moving forward.<br/>Explanation: Antiparallel vectors point in opposite directions. If the car is moving forward (positive velocity) and slowing down, the acceleration must be in the opposite direction (negative) to decrease the velocity, indicating antiparallel vectors. | 30a. Which of the following best describes the acceleration of a projectile in the horizontal (x) direction during its flight, assuming negligible air resistance?<br/>A. It decreases linearly due to the absence of a horizontal force.<br/>B. It remains constant at 9.8 m/s² downward.<br/>C. It is zero because no horizontal force acts on it.<br/>D. It increases exponentially as the projectile loses altitude.<br/>Answer: C. It is zero because no horizontal force acts on it.<br/>Explanation: In projectile motion, gravity acts only vertically, so there is no horizontal acceleration (Newton’s first law).<br/><br/>30b. A ball is launched horizontally from a cliff. Which of the following correctly compares the time it takes to hit the ground to the time it would take if dropped from rest at the same height?<br/>A. The launched ball takes longer because it has an initial horizontal velocity.<br/>B. The launched ball takes less time because its trajectory is curved.<br/>C. Both take the same time because vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion.<br/>D. The launched ball’s time depends on its mass, unlike the dropped ball.<br/>Answer: C. Both take the same time because vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion.<br/>Explanation: Vertical acceleration (g) is unaffected by horizontal velocity, so the time to fall depends only on initial vertical velocity (zero in both cases).<br/><br/>30c. Which physical principle explains why the horizontal component of velocity for a projectile remains unchanged throughout its flight?<br/>A. Conservation of momentum in the x-direction<br/>B. Newton’s third law of action-reaction<br/>C. The work-energy theorem<br/>D. The independence of perpendicular motions<br/>Answer: D. The independence of perpendicular motions<br/>Explanation: Projectile motion’s x- and y-components are independent; without horizontal forces, horizontal velocity is constant (Newton’s first law). |
| 31 | Projectile motion contains both an x- and y-component. Assuming negligible air resistance, the only force acting on the object is gravity. | 31a. Which of the following best describes the forces acting on a projectile in motion, assuming air resistance is negligible?<br/>A. Both gravity and a forward force act on the projectile<br/>B. Only gravity acts on the projectile<br/>C. Gravity and a constant upward force act on the projectile<br/>D. Gravity and friction act on the projectile<br/>Answer: B. Only gravity acts on the projectile<br/>Explanation: In ideal projectile motion, the only force acting on the object after launch is gravity, which acts downward; there is no forward or frictional force when air resistance is neglected.<br/><br/>31b. During projectile motion, which component of velocity remains constant if air resistance is negligible?<br/>A. The vertical (y) component<br/>B. Both the vertical (y) and horizontal (x) components<br/>C. The horizontal (x) component<br/>D. Neither component<br/>Answer: C. The horizontal (x) component<br/>Explanation: Without air resistance, gravity only affects the vertical component of velocity; the horizontal component remains constant throughout the motion.<br/><br/>31c. A student claims that a projectile slows down in the horizontal direction due to gravity. What is the correct evaluation of this statement?<br/>A. Correct, gravity slows horizontal motion<br/>B. Incorrect, gravity only affects vertical motion<br/>C. Correct, gravity affects both vertical and horizontal motion equally<br/>D. Incorrect, gravity has no effect on projectile motion<br/>Answer: B. Incorrect, gravity only affects vertical motion<br/>Explanation: Gravity acts downward, affecting only the vertical (y) component of motion; it does not influence the horizontal (x) component in the absence of air resistance. | 31a. A projectile is launched horizontally. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following statements best describes the projectile's motion?<br/>A. The horizontal velocity is constant, and the vertical velocity increases linearly.<br/>B. The horizontal velocity increases linearly, and the vertical velocity is constant.<br/>C. Both the horizontal and vertical velocities increase linearly.<br/>D. Both the horizontal and vertical velocities are constant.<br/>Answer: A. The horizontal velocity is constant, and the vertical velocity increases linearly.<br/>Explanation: In projectile motion without air resistance, the horizontal velocity remains constant due to inertia. The vertical velocity increases linearly due to the constant acceleration of gravity.<br/><br/>31b. Two projectiles are launched with the same initial speed but at different angles. Projectile A is launched at 30° above the horizontal, and projectile B is launched at 60° above the horizontal. Neglecting air resistance, which of the following is true?<br/>A. Projectile A experiences a greater horizontal acceleration than Projectile B.<br/>B. Projectile B experiences a greater horizontal acceleration than Projectile A.<br/>C. Both projectiles experience the same non-zero horizontal acceleration.<br/>D. Both projectiles experience zero horizontal acceleration.<br/>Answer: D. Both projectiles experience zero horizontal acceleration.<br/>Explanation: In projectile motion, the only force acting on the object is gravity, which acts vertically. Therefore, the horizontal acceleration is zero for both projectiles, regardless of their launch angle.<br/><br/>31c. A cannon fires a projectile. If air resistance is negligible, what happens to the projectile's vertical acceleration during its flight?<br/>A. It increases continuously.<br/>B. It decreases continuously.<br/>C. It remains constant.<br/>D. It is zero at the peak of the trajectory.<br/>Answer: C. It remains constant.<br/>Explanation: Neglecting air resistance, the only force acting on the projectile is gravity, which results in a constant downward acceleration. The vertical acceleration remains constant throughout the projectile's entire trajectory. | 31a. When analyzing the forces on an object placed on an inclined plane, why is it advantageous to resolve the gravitational force into components parallel and perpendicular to the plane’s surface?<br/>A. It simplifies the calculation of net force by aligning one axis with the direction of acceleration.<br/>B. It eliminates the need to consider the normal force in equilibrium problems.<br/>C. It ensures the frictional force is always directed parallel to the plane.<br/>D. It allows the gravitational constant to be treated as a variable dependent on angle.<br/>Answer: A. It simplifies the calculation of net force by aligning one axis with the direction of acceleration.<br/>Explanation: Resolving forces into parallel (along the plane) and perpendicular (normal to the plane) components aligns one axis with the direction of motion, reducing the problem to a simpler one-dimensional analysis along the incline.<br/><br/>31b. A block is at rest on an inclined plane. Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the component of gravitational force parallel to the plane (Fₚ) and the frictional force (fₛ) acting on the block?<br/>A. Fₚ is greater than fₛ, causing the block to accelerate down the plane.<br/>B. Fₛ is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to Fₚ, maintaining equilibrium.<br/>C. Fₛ is independent of Fₚ and depends only on the coefficient of static friction.<br/>D. Fₚ and fₛ act in the same direction, both opposing motion.<br/>Answer: B. Fₛ is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to Fₚ, maintaining equilibrium.<br/>Explanation: For a block at rest, the static frictional force exactly balances the parallel component of gravity, resulting in net zero force and no acceleration.<br/><br/>31c. Which of the following scenarios would result in the normal force (N) on an object on an inclined plane being equal to the object’s weight (mg)?<br/>A. The plane is horizontal (angle θ = 0°).<br/>B. The plane is vertical (angle θ = 90°).<br/>C. The object is accelerating down the plane.<br/>D. The object is in free fall.<br/>Answer: A. The plane is horizontal (angle θ = 0°).<br/>Explanation: When the plane is horizontal, the perpendicular component of gravity equals the full weight (mg), and the parallel component is zero, so N = mg. |
| 32 | Inclined planes are another example of two-dimensional movement. It is often easiest to consider the dimensions as being parallel and perpendicular to the surface of the plane. | 32a. When analyzing motion on an inclined plane, why is it advantageous to resolve forces into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface?<br/>A. It simplifies calculations by aligning with the directions of acceleration and normal force.<br/>B. It eliminates the need to consider gravitational force.<br/>C. It allows friction to be ignored in all cases.<br/>D. It is only necessary for horizontal surfaces.<br/>Answer: A. It simplifies calculations by aligning with the directions of acceleration and normal force.<br/>Explanation: Resolving forces parallel and perpendicular to the inclined surface aligns with the directions of key forces (gravity, normal force, friction), simplifying analysis—an essential technique for MCAT physics problems.<br/><br/>32b. Which of the following best describes the two-dimensional nature of motion on an inclined plane?<br/>A. Motion occurs only vertically.<br/>B. Motion can be described using components along and perpendicular to the plane's surface.<br/>C. Motion is always circular.<br/>D. Motion is unaffected by gravity.<br/>Answer: B. Motion can be described using components along and perpendicular to the plane's surface.<br/>Explanation: On an inclined plane, movement and forces are best described in two dimensions: parallel and perpendicular to the surface, reflecting the plane's geometry and the direction of forces.<br/><br/>32c. A student claims that analyzing forces on an inclined plane is identical to analyzing forces on a flat (horizontal) surface. Which statement best refutes this claim?<br/>A. The normal force on an incline always equals the object's weight.<br/>B. Gravity acts only perpendicular to the surface on an incline.<br/>C. On an incline, gravitational force must be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.<br/>D. Friction does not exist on inclined planes.<br/>Answer: C. On an incline, gravitational force must be resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.<br/>Explanation: Unlike flat surfaces, inclined planes require resolving gravity into two components due to the angle, which affects both the normal force and the object's acceleration down the plane. | 32a. A block slides down a frictionless inclined plane. If the angle of the incline with respect to the horizontal is increased, what happens to the component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the plane?<br/>A. It decreases.<br/>B. It increases.<br/>C. It remains the same.<br/>D. It becomes zero.<br/>Answer: B. It increases.<br/>Explanation: The component of gravitational force parallel to the inclined plane is *mg*sinθ. As θ increases, sinθ also increases, resulting in a larger parallel component of the gravitational force.<br/><br/>32b. A box is at rest on an inclined plane. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the static frictional force acting on the box?<br/>A. It is equal to the weight of the box.<br/>B. It is equal to the component of the weight of the box perpendicular to the plane.<br/>C. It is equal to the component of the weight of the box parallel to the plane.<br/>D. It is zero since the box is not moving.<br/>Answer: C. It is equal to the component of the weight of the box parallel to the plane.<br/>Explanation: Since the box is stationary, the static frictional force must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the inclined plane, ensuring the net force is zero.<br/><br/>32c. A crate is being pushed up an inclined plane at a constant velocity. If the plane were perfectly horizontal instead, and the crate was pushed across it at the same constant velocity, which of the following must be true?<br/>A. The required pushing force would be less.<br/>B. The required pushing force would be greater.<br/>C. The required pushing force would be the same.<br/>D. The relationship between the required pushing forces cannot be determined without knowing the coefficient of friction.<br/>Answer: A. The required pushing force would be less.<br/>Explanation: On an inclined plane, the pushing force must overcome both friction and the component of gravity parallel to the plane. On a horizontal surface, it only needs to overcome friction (which may be reduced due to a lower normal force). | 32a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between centripetal force and tangential velocity in uniform circular motion?<br/>A. Centripetal force is perpendicular to tangential velocity and causes a change in its magnitude.<br/>B. Centripetal force is parallel to tangential velocity and causes a change in its direction.<br/>C. Centripetal force is perpendicular to tangential velocity and causes a change in its direction.<br/>D. Centripetal force is independent of tangential velocity and does not affect motion.<br/>Answer: C. Centripetal force is perpendicular to tangential velocity and causes a change in its direction.<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, centripetal force acts radially inward, perpendicular to the tangential velocity, altering only the direction of motion (not speed).<br/><br/>32b. A ball attached to a string moves in a horizontal circle at constant speed. If the string breaks at the instant shown, in which direction will the ball initially move?<br/>A. Radially inward, toward the center of the circle<br/>B. Radially outward, away from the center of the circle<br/>C. Tangentially, along the instantaneous velocity vector<br/>D. Vertically downward due to gravity<br/>Answer: C. Tangentially, along the instantaneous velocity vector<br/>Explanation: Upon release, the ball follows Newton’s first law, moving in the direction of its instantaneous velocity—tangent to the circular path—since no centripetal force remains.<br/><br/>32c. Which scenario correctly distinguishes between radial and tangential components in non-uniform circular motion?<br/>A. Radial acceleration is zero, while tangential acceleration changes speed.<br/>B. Tangential acceleration is zero, while radial acceleration changes direction.<br/>C. Radial acceleration is constant, while tangential acceleration is zero.<br/>D. Both radial and tangential accelerations are non-zero, altering speed and direction.<br/>Answer: D. Both radial and tangential accelerations are non-zero, altering speed and direction.<br/>Explanation: Non-uniform circular motion involves centripetal (radial) acceleration to change direction and tangential acceleration to change speed, requiring both components. |
| 33 | Circular motion is best thought of as having radial and tangential dimensions. In uniform circular motion, the only force is the centripetal force, pointing radially inward. The instantaneous velocity vector always points tangentially. | 33a. Which of the following best describes the direction of the instantaneous velocity vector for an object undergoing uniform circular motion?<br/>A. Radially inward toward the center of the circle<br/>B. Radially outward from the center of the circle<br/>C. Tangential to the path at every point<br/>D. Perpendicular to the plane of the circle<br/>Answer: C. Tangential to the path at every point<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, the instantaneous velocity vector is always tangent to the circle at the object's position, reflecting the direction of motion.<br/><br/>33b. During uniform circular motion, which force is responsible for maintaining the object's path, and in which direction does it act?<br/>A. Centripetal force, acting radially inward<br/>B. Centrifugal force, acting radially outward<br/>C. Gravitational force, acting tangentially<br/>D. Normal force, acting perpendicular to the motion<br/>Answer: A. Centripetal force, acting radially inward<br/>Explanation: The centripetal force is the net force that always points toward the center of the circle, keeping the object in its circular path.<br/><br/>33c. A student claims that in uniform circular motion, there must be a tangential force to maintain constant speed. Which of the following best evaluates this claim?<br/>A. Correct, because tangential force is needed to keep the object moving<br/>B. Incorrect, because only a radial (centripetal) force is needed for constant speed<br/>C. Correct, because tangential force balances the centripetal force<br/>D. Incorrect, because no forces are required in circular motion<br/>Answer: B. Incorrect, because only a radial (centripetal) force is needed for constant speed<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, speed is constant, so only a centripetal (radial) force is required; a tangential force would change the speed. | 33a. Question text<br/>An object is moving in uniform circular motion. Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between the net force acting on the object and its instantaneous velocity?<br/>A. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always parallel.<br/>B. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always anti-parallel.<br/>C. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always perpendicular.<br/>D. The net force and instantaneous velocity have a constant, non-zero angle between them.<br/>Answer: C. The net force and instantaneous velocity are always perpendicular.<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, the net force (centripetal force) points radially inward, while the instantaneous velocity points tangentially. These directions are always perpendicular.<br/><br/>33b. Question text<br/>A car is traveling around a circular track at a constant speed. If the track were suddenly covered in ice, eliminating all radial friction, which of the following best describes the car's subsequent motion?<br/>A. The car will continue to move in a circle with a decreasing radius.<br/>B. The car will continue to move in a circle with an increasing radius.<br/>C. The car will move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point where the ice began.<br/>D. The car will immediately come to a complete stop.<br/>Answer: C. The car will move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point where the ice began.<br/>Explanation: Without the centripetal force provided by friction, the car will obey Newton's first law and continue in a straight line along its instantaneous velocity vector, which is tangent to the circle.<br/><br/>33c. Question text<br/>Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of uniform circular motion?<br/>A. Constant tangential speed.<br/>B. Constant radial acceleration.<br/>C. Constant kinetic energy.<br/>D. Constant radial velocity.<br/>Answer: D. Constant radial velocity.<br/>Explanation: In uniform circular motion, there is no movement in or out of the circle. This means that there cannot be a radial velocity, only a radial acceleration because the direction is changing. | 33a. Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of a free body diagram in physics?<br/>A. To illustrate the trajectory of an object in projectile motion<br/>B. To represent all forces acting on a single object in isolation<br/>C. To calculate the net work done by non-conservative forces<br/>D. To depict the velocity and acceleration vectors of a system<br/>Answer: B. To represent all forces acting on a single object in isolation<br/>Explanation: Free body diagrams focus solely on the forces acting *on* one object, excluding other objects or motion characteristics like velocity or trajectory.<br/><br/>33b. A block rests on a rough inclined plane. Which of the following forces would NOT appear on its free body diagram?<br/>A. The normal force perpendicular to the plane<br/>B. The gravitational force directed vertically downward<br/>C. The frictional force parallel to the plane opposing motion<br/>D. The gravitational force exerted by the block on Earth<br/>Answer: D. The gravitational force exerted by the block on Earth<br/>Explanation: Free body diagrams only include forces *acting on* the object, not forces the object exerts on others (Newton’s third law pairs are excluded).<br/><br/>33c. In a free body diagram for a skydiver falling at terminal velocity, which feature distinguishes it from the diagram of the same skydiver accelerating downward?<br/>A. The direction of the gravitational force vector<br/>B. The presence of an upward drag force<br/>C. The relative magnitudes of drag and gravitational forces<br/>D. The inclusion of a centripetal force<br/>Answer: C. The relative magnitudes of drag and gravitational forces<br/>Explanation: At terminal velocity, drag equals gravity (net force = 0), whereas during acceleration, drag is smaller than gravity (net force ≠ 0); this distinction is critical for equilibrium vs. dynamics analysis. |
| 34 | Free body diagrams are representations of the forces acting on an object. They are useful for equilibrium and dynamics problems. | 34a. Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of a free body diagram in physics?<br/>A. To illustrate the motion path of an object over time<br/>B. To represent all the forces acting on a single object<br/>C. To calculate the mass of an object<br/>D. To show the velocity vectors of an object<br/>Answer: B. To represent all the forces acting on a single object<br/>Explanation: A free body diagram visually displays all external forces acting on a specific object, which is essential for analyzing equilibrium and dynamics.<br/><br/>34b. When constructing a free body diagram for an object on an inclined plane, which of the following forces should NOT be included?<br/>A. Gravitational force acting on the object<br/>B. Normal force from the surface<br/>C. The object's acceleration vector<br/>D. Frictional force between the object and the plane<br/>Answer: C. The object's acceleration vector<br/>Explanation: Free body diagrams include only forces acting on the object, not its acceleration or velocity vectors.<br/><br/>34c. Why are free body diagrams particularly useful when analyzing objects in equilibrium?<br/>A. They show the net force is always nonzero<br/>B. They help visualize and ensure that the sum of forces equals zero<br/>C. They eliminate the need to consider external forces<br/>D. They provide a direct measurement of force magnitudes<br/>Answer: B. They help visualize and ensure that the sum of forces equals zero<br/>Explanation: For equilibrium, the net force on an object must be zero; free body diagrams help identify and balance all forces to confirm this condition. | 34a. A student is analyzing the motion of a box sliding down an inclined plane. Which of the following forces must be represented in a free body diagram of the box?<br/>A. The force the box exerts on the inclined plane.<br/>B. The net force acting on the box.<br/>C. The gravitational force exerted on the box by the Earth.<br/>D. The force exerted by the box's motion.<br/>Answer: C. The gravitational force exerted on the box by the Earth.<br/>Explanation: A free body diagram represents forces acting *on* the object, not forces exerted *by* the object (Newton's third law). The net force is a result of forces, not a force itself. Fictitious forces (box's motion) are not included.<br/><br/>34b. Two blocks are connected by a rope over a pulley. A student wants to determine if the system is in translational equilibrium. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate use of free body diagrams in this scenario?<br/>A. To visually represent only the internal forces within the system.<br/>B. To visually represent all forces acting on each block to determine if the net force on each block is zero.<br/>C. To visually represent only the forces acting on the pulley.<br/>D. To calculate the acceleration of the system, regardless of equilibrium.<br/>Answer: B. To visually represent all forces acting on each block to determine if the net force on each block is zero.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium requires the net force on *each* object to be zero. Free body diagrams are crucial for visualizing all external forces acting on each block. While internal forces are present, considering external forces on each object is critical for equilibrium.<br/><br/>34c. A physicist is evaluating the forces acting on a stationary object resting on a table. Which of the following force pairs is LEAST likely to be represented on a free body diagram of the object?<br/>A. Weight and Normal Force<br/>B. Applied Force and Friction Force<br/>C. Tension and Weight<br/>D. Action Force and Reaction Force<br/>Answer: D. Action Force and Reaction Force<br/>Explanation: Free body diagrams only include forces *acting on* the object. While action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, they act on different objects (Newton's 3rd Law). Options A, B, and C all describe force pairs where one or both forces act on the object in question. | 34a. Which of the following best describes the relationship between translational equilibrium and an object’s motion?<br/><br/>34b. A block slides at 5 m/s on a frictionless horizontal surface. Which statement about its equilibrium is correct?<br/><br/>34c. Which scenario violates the condition for translational equilibrium? |
| 35 | Translational equilibrium occurs in the absence of any net forces acting on an object. An object in translational equilibrium has a constant velocity, and may or may not also be in rotational equilibrium. | 35a. Which of the following best describes the condition required for an object to be in translational equilibrium?<br/>A. The object must have zero velocity.<br/>B. The net force acting on the object must be zero.<br/>C. The object must be at rest and not rotating.<br/>D. The net torque acting on the object must be zero.<br/>Answer: B. The net force acting on the object must be zero.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium requires that the sum of all forces acting on the object is zero, resulting in constant velocity (which could be zero or nonzero).<br/><br/>35b. An object is sliding across a frictionless surface at a constant velocity. Which of the following statements must be true about the object?<br/>A. It is in translational equilibrium but not necessarily in rotational equilibrium.<br/>B. It is in both translational and rotational equilibrium.<br/>C. It is accelerating due to a net force.<br/>D. It must be rotating to maintain equilibrium.<br/>Answer: A. It is in translational equilibrium but not necessarily in rotational equilibrium.<br/>Explanation: Constant velocity implies no net force (translational equilibrium), but nothing is specified about torques or rotational motion.<br/><br/>35c. Which scenario demonstrates a violation of translational equilibrium?<br/>A. A book resting motionless on a table.<br/>B. A car moving at constant speed in a straight line.<br/>C. A hockey puck slowing down due to friction.<br/>D. A satellite orbiting Earth at constant speed in a circular path.<br/>Answer: C. A hockey puck slowing down due to friction.<br/>Explanation: The puck is decelerating, indicating a net force is present and translational equilibrium is not maintained. | 35a. A stationary box rests on a horizontal surface. Which of the following statements best describes the forces acting on the box?<br/>A. The box experiences a net upward force due to the surface.<br/>B. The box experiences a net downward force due to gravity exceeding the normal force.<br/>C. The box is in translational equilibrium because the net force acting on it is zero.<br/>D. The box is not in translational equilibrium because it is not moving.<br/>Answer: C. The box is in translational equilibrium because the net force acting on it is zero.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium requires the net force to be zero. Since the box is stationary, the gravitational force is balanced by the normal force from the surface, resulting in zero net force and thus translational equilibrium.<br/><br/>35b. A spacecraft is drifting through interstellar space with its engines off at a constant velocity. Which of the following must be true?<br/>A. There are no forces acting on the spacecraft.<br/>B. The spacecraft is in rotational equilibrium but not necessarily translational equilibrium.<br/>C. The net force on the spacecraft is zero, indicating translational equilibrium.<br/>D. The spacecraft's inertia is constantly increasing.<br/>Answer: C. The net force on the spacecraft is zero, indicating translational equilibrium.<br/>Explanation: Constant velocity implies zero acceleration. According to Newton's first law, zero acceleration means the net force acting on the object must be zero, which is the condition for translational equilibrium.<br/><br/>35c. An object experiencing a constant non-zero net torque cannot be in translational equilibrium under which condition?<br/>A. If the object is also experiencing a constant non-zero net force.<br/>B. If the object's center of mass is accelerating.<br/>C. If the object's angular velocity is constant.<br/>D. If the object's moment of inertia is constant.<br/>Answer: A. If the object is also experiencing a constant non-zero net force.<br/>Explanation: Translational equilibrium necessitates a zero net force. Therefore, an object experiencing a non-zero net force cannot be in translational equilibrium, regardless of any torques acting on it. | 35a. Which of the following best describes the condition required for an object to be in rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. The sum of all forces acting on the object must be zero.<br/>B. The sum of all torques acting on the object about any pivot point must be zero.<br/>C. The object must be stationary with no translational or rotational motion.<br/>D. The center of mass must coincide with the geometric center of the object.<br/>Answer: B. The sum of all torques acting on the object about any pivot point must be zero.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium is defined by zero net torque, not necessarily zero net force (which defines translational equilibrium). The pivot point can be chosen arbitrarily, though the center of mass is often used for simplicity.<br/><br/>35b. A uniform meterstick is balanced at its center. If a mass is added to the left end, which of the following adjustments would restore rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. Moving the pivot point to the left of the center.<br/>B. Adding an equal mass to the right end at the same distance from the pivot.<br/>C. Increasing the length of the meterstick while keeping the pivot at the center.<br/>D. Applying a downward force at the original pivot point.<br/>Answer: B. Adding an equal mass to the right end at the same distance from the pivot.<br/>Explanation: To restore equilibrium, the counterclockwise torque (from the added mass on the left) must be balanced by an equal clockwise torque, achieved by placing an equal mass symmetrically on the right.<br/><br/>35c. Which scenario does NOT necessarily imply rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. A spinning figure skater pulling their arms inward, increasing angular velocity.<br/>B. A stationary seesaw with children of equal weight seated at equal distances from the fulcrum.<br/>C. A door remaining motionless after being pushed open to a 90-degree angle.<br/>D. A bicycle wheel rotating at a constant speed about its axle.<br/>Answer: A. A spinning figure skater pulling their arms inward, increasing angular velocity.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium requires constant angular velocity (including zero). The skater’s angular velocity changes due to conservation of angular momentum, so net torque is not zero. The other scenarios describe zero net torque (equilibrium). |
| 36 | Rotational equilibrium occurs in the absence of any net torques acting on an object. Rotational motion may consider any pivot point, but the center of mass is most common. An object in rotational equilibrium has a constant angular velocity; on the MCAT, the angular velocity is usually zero. | 36a. Which of the following best describes the condition necessary for an object to be in rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. The net force acting on the object must be zero.<br/>B. The net torque acting on the object must be zero.<br/>C. The object must be at rest.<br/>D. The object must be rotating at a constant speed.<br/>Answer: B. The net torque acting on the object must be zero.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium requires that the sum of all torques acting on an object is zero, ensuring no change in angular velocity.<br/><br/>36b. If an object is in rotational equilibrium, which of the following statements must be true regarding its angular velocity?<br/>A. The angular velocity must be increasing.<br/>B. The angular velocity must be zero.<br/>C. The angular velocity must be constant.<br/>D. The angular velocity must be decreasing.<br/>Answer: C. The angular velocity must be constant.<br/>Explanation: In rotational equilibrium, the absence of net torque means angular velocity does not change, though it can be zero or nonzero.<br/><br/>36c. A student claims that an object in rotational equilibrium must always be motionless. Which of the following best addresses this misconception?<br/>A. Rotational equilibrium requires zero linear velocity, not angular velocity.<br/>B. Rotational equilibrium only requires that the object is not accelerating linearly.<br/>C. Rotational equilibrium means the object's angular velocity is constant, which can include being motionless or spinning steadily.<br/>D. Rotational equilibrium means there are no forces acting on the object.<br/>Answer: C. Rotational equilibrium means the object's angular velocity is constant, which can include being motionless or spinning steadily.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium implies constant angular velocity, so the object can be at rest or rotating uniformly; motionlessness is not required. | 36a. An irregularly shaped object is suspended from a string attached to a single point on the object. The object is at rest. Which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the torques acting on the object?<br/>A. The net torque about the point of suspension is non-zero, but the net torque about the center of mass is zero.<br/>B. The net torque about both the point of suspension and the center of mass is zero.<br/>C. The net torque about the point of suspension is zero, but the net torque about the center of mass is non-zero.<br/>D. The net torque about both the point of suspension and the center of mass is non-zero.<br/>Answer: B. The net torque about both the point of suspension and the center of mass is zero.<br/>Explanation: The object is in rotational equilibrium, meaning the net torque about any point is zero, including the suspension point and the center of mass. Any non-zero net torque would result in angular acceleration.<br/><br/>36b. A seesaw with unequal arm lengths is perfectly balanced with a child on each end. Which of the following must be true regarding the torques exerted by the children on the seesaw, taking the fulcrum (pivot point) as the reference?<br/>A. The child on the longer arm exerts a greater torque.<br/>B. The child on the shorter arm exerts a greater torque.<br/>C. The torques exerted by each child are equal in magnitude.<br/>D. The torque exerted by the heavier child is greater.<br/>Answer: C. The torques exerted by each child are equal in magnitude.<br/>Explanation: For the seesaw to be in rotational equilibrium, the net torque must be zero. This implies that the clockwise and counterclockwise torques are equal in magnitude, regardless of the arm lengths or the children's weights.<br/><br/>36c. Which of the following scenarios best exemplifies an object NOT in rotational equilibrium?<br/>A. A ceiling fan rotating at a constant angular velocity.<br/>B. A bicycle wheel spinning freely on an axle with no external forces applied.<br/>C. A door held ajar by a doorstop.<br/>D. A merry-go-round slowing down to a stop.<br/>Answer: D. A merry-go-round slowing down to a stop.<br/>Explanation: Rotational equilibrium requires a constant angular velocity (including zero). A merry-go-round slowing down indicates a changing angular velocity and thus a net torque acting on it, meaning it's not in rotational equilibrium. | - |
