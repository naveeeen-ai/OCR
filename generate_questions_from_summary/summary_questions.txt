**1. Which of the following is NOT an SI base unit?**
A. Meter
B. Kilogram
C. Liter
D. Second
**Correct Answer: C. Liter**
**Explanation:** The SI (International System of Units) base units are meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), kelvin (thermodynamic temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity). The liter is a unit of volume, derived from the cubic meter (m³).  This is a crucial concept for understanding unit conversions and dimensional analysis on the MCAT.


**2. Which of the following best describes a vector quantity?**
A. It has only magnitude.
B. It has only direction.
C. It has both magnitude and direction.
D. It is dimensionless.
**Correct Answer: C. It has both magnitude and direction.**
**Explanation:** Vector quantities, unlike scalar quantities, possess both magnitude (size) and direction.  Understanding the difference between vectors (like velocity, force, acceleration) and scalars (like mass, speed, temperature) is fundamental to physics problem-solving on the MCAT.


**3. Which of the following is a scalar quantity?**
A. Velocity
B. Force
C. Mass
D. Acceleration
**Correct Answer: C. Mass**
**Explanation:** Mass is a scalar quantity; it has magnitude but no direction. Velocity, force, and acceleration are all vector quantities.  This distinction is crucial for correctly applying equations and understanding physical phenomena.


**4. A car travels 5 km east and then 3 km west. What is its displacement?**
A. 8 km east
B. 2 km east
C. 8 km west
D. 2 km west
**Correct Answer: B. 2 km east**
**Explanation:** Displacement is a vector quantity representing the shortest distance between the starting and ending points.  The car's net movement is 2 km to the east (5 km east - 3 km west).  The MCAT often tests the understanding of displacement versus distance.


**5. A car travels 5 km east and then 3 km west. What is the total distance traveled?**
A. 2 km
B. 8 km
C. 5 km
D. 3 km
**Correct Answer: B. 8 km**
**Explanation:** Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total ground covered. The car traveled 5 km + 3 km = 8 km in total.  This question highlights the difference between distance (scalar) and displacement (vector).


**6. Which of the following best defines velocity?**
A. The total distance traveled
B. The rate of change of distance
C. The rate of change of displacement
D. The total displacement
**Correct Answer: C. The rate of change of displacement**
**Explanation:** Velocity is a vector quantity defined as the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.  It's crucial to remember the vector nature of velocity; it includes both speed and direction.


**7. What is the relationship between speed and velocity?**
A. Speed is the direction of velocity.
B. Speed is the opposite of velocity.
C. Speed is the magnitude of velocity.
D. Speed is the square of velocity.
**Correct Answer: C. Speed is the magnitude of velocity.**
**Explanation:** Speed is the scalar magnitude of the velocity vector. Velocity includes both speed and direction; speed is just the "how fast" part.  This is a key distinction frequently tested on the MCAT.


**8. A runner completes a 400-meter track in 60 seconds.  Assuming they finish at their starting point, what is their average velocity?**
A.  400 m/s
B. 6.67 m/s
C. 0 m/s
D.  Cannot be determined
**Correct Answer: C. 0 m/s**
**Explanation:** Average velocity is the total displacement divided by the total time. Since the runner finishes at the starting point, their total displacement is zero, resulting in an average velocity of 0 m/s.


**9. A runner runs 500 meters north, then 500 meters south in 100 seconds. What is their average speed?**
A. 0 m/s
B. 5 m/s
C. 10 m/s
D. 50 m/s
**Correct Answer: C. 10 m/s**
**Explanation:** Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The runner covers a total distance of 1000 meters (500 m north + 500 m south) in 100 seconds.  Therefore, the average speed is 1000 m / 100 s = 10 m/s.


**10. Instantaneous velocity is best described as:**
A. The average velocity over a long period.
B. The velocity at a specific instant in time.
C. The total displacement divided by total time.
D. The change in velocity over time.
**Correct Answer: B. The velocity at a specific instant in time.**
**Explanation:** Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a single point in time, as opposed to average velocity, which considers a time interval.


**11. How does instantaneous speed relate to instantaneous velocity?**
A. It is the direction of instantaneous velocity.
B. It is the opposite of instantaneous velocity.
C. It is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.
D. It is the inverse of instantaneous velocity.
**Correct Answer: C. It is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.**
**Explanation:** Similar to the relationship between speed and velocity in general, instantaneous speed is simply the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vector.

C. Kinetic friction is a constant value, while static friction varies.
D. Kinetic friction depends on velocity while static friction does not.
**Correct Answer: A. Kinetic friction is always less than static friction.**
**Explanation:** It requires more force to overcome static friction and initiate movement than to maintain movement against kinetic friction.  Both are proportional to the normal force.


**18. Which statement regarding coefficients of friction is correct?**
A. The coefficient of kinetic friction is greater than the coefficient of static friction.
B. The coefficients of friction are dimensionless quantities.
C. The coefficient of static friction is less than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
D. The coefficient of friction is dependent on the area of contact.
**Correct Answer: B. The coefficients of friction are dimensionless quantities.**
**Explanation:** Coefficients of friction (μ) are ratios of forces and therefore have no units.  The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.


**19. Mass is a measure of:**
A. The force of gravity on an object.
B. The amount of space an object occupies.
C. An object's resistance to changes in motion.
D. The object's density.
**Correct Answer: C. An object's resistance to changes in motion.**
**Explanation:** Mass is a measure of inertia – an object's resistance to acceleration. Weight (A) is the force of gravity, volume (B) is the amount of space, and density (D) is mass per unit volume.


**20. Weight is best defined as:**
A. The amount of matter in an object.
B. The force due to gravity on an object's mass.
C. An object's resistance to acceleration.
D. A measure of an object's inertia.
**Correct Answer: B. The force due to gravity on an object's mass.**
**Explanation:** Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity.  It is a force, not a property of the object itself like mass.


**21. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of:**
A. Displacement.
B. Distance.
C. Velocity.
D. Speed.
**Correct Answer: C. Velocity.**
**Explanation:** Acceleration is a vector quantity representing the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

A. Perpendicular
B. At an angle
C. Parallel or antiparallel

B. Gravity is the only significant force acting on the projectile.
C. The projectile's trajectory is a straight line.
D. Air resistance significantly alters the path.
**Correct Answer: B. Gravity is the only significant force acting on the projectile.**
**Explanation:** Neglecting air resistance, only gravity acts on a projectile, resulting in a parabolic trajectory.

A. Parallel and perpendicular to the incline.
B. Only parallel to the incline.
C. Only perpendicular to the incline.
D. At 45-degree angles to the incline.

**32. An object in translational equilibrium will have:**
A. A constantly changing velocity.
B. Constant acceleration.
C. Constant velocity.
D. Zero velocity.
**Correct Answer: C. Constant velocity.**
