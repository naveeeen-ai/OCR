**1. A projectile is launched at an angle of 30° above the horizontal with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Ignoring air resistance, what is the approximate vertical component of its initial velocity?**
A. 10 m/s
B. 17.3 m/s
C. 20 m/s
D. 0 m/s
**Correct Answer: A. 10 m/s**
**Explanation:** The vertical component of the initial velocity is given by V₀sinθ, where V₀ is the initial velocity (20 m/s) and θ is the launch angle (30°).  Therefore, the vertical component is 20 m/s * sin(30°) = 20 m/s * 0.5 = 10 m/s.  This is a fundamental concept in projectile motion; understanding vector decomposition is crucial for MCAT physics.


**2. A 5 kg object experiences a net force of 10 N. According to Newton's second law, what is its acceleration?**
A. 0.5 m/s²
B. 2 m/s²
C. 5 m/s²
D. 50 m/s²
**Correct Answer: B. 2 m/s²**
**Explanation:** Newton's second law states F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.  Solving for acceleration, a = F/m = 10 N / 5 kg = 2 m/s². This is a direct application of a core physics principle frequently tested on the MCAT.


**3. Two objects, one with mass m and the other with mass 2m, are dropped from the same height in a vacuum. Which object hits the ground first?**
A. The object with mass m
B. The object with mass 2m
C. They hit the ground simultaneously.
D. It depends on the shape of the objects.
**Correct Answer: C. They hit the ground simultaneously.**
**Explanation:** In a vacuum, there is no air resistance.  Therefore, the only force acting on both objects is gravity, which causes both to accelerate at the same rate (g, approximately 9.8 m/s²), regardless of their mass. This demonstrates a key concept of gravitational acceleration.


**4. A car travels 100 km in 2 hours. What is its average speed?**
A. 200 km/hr
B. 50 km/hr
C. 25 km/hr
D. 100 km/hr
**Correct Answer: B. 50 km/hr**
**Explanation:** Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time.  Average speed = 100 km / 2 hours = 50 km/hr.  This is a basic calculation, but understanding the difference between speed and velocity is important for the MCAT.


**5. A block rests on an inclined plane. Which force is responsible for preventing the block from sliding down the plane?**
A. Kinetic friction
B. Gravity
C. Normal force
D. Static friction
**Correct Answer: D. Static friction**
**Explanation:** Static friction is the force that opposes the initiation of motion between two surfaces in contact.  Since the block is at rest, it's static friction that prevents it from sliding down the incline. Kinetic friction would only be relevant if the block were already sliding.


**6. What is the dot product of two vectors, A = (3i + 4j) and B = (2i - 1j), where i and j are unit vectors?**
A. 2
B. 10
C. 5i - j
D. 6i - 4j
**Correct Answer: A. 2**
**Explanation:** The dot product is calculated as (3*2) + (4*-1) = 6 - 4 = 2.  Remember that the dot product results in a scalar value, not a vector.  Understanding vector operations is important for certain MCAT physics problems.


**7. A ball is thrown straight upward. At its highest point, what is its instantaneous velocity?**
A. Zero
B. Equal to its initial velocity
C. Equal to the acceleration due to gravity
D. Undefined
**Correct Answer: A. Zero**
**Explanation:** At the highest point of its trajectory, the ball momentarily stops before changing direction.  Instantaneous velocity is zero at that specific point in time.  The acceleration due to gravity remains constant throughout the flight (-9.8 m/s²).


**8. What principle explains why a person feels a force pushing them outward when they are on a merry-go-round?**
A. Centripetal force
B. Centrifugal force
C. Inertia
D. Gravitational force
**Correct Answer: C. Inertia**
**Explanation:** The sensation of being pushed outward is due to inertia.  The person's body wants to continue moving in a straight line, but the merry-go-round forces it to move in a circle.  Centrifugal force is a fictitious force; the actual force is centripetal, which pulls the person inward.


**9. A 10 kg mass hangs from a rope. What is the tension in the rope (assume g = 10 m/s²)?**
A. 0 N
B. 1 N
C. 10 N
D. 100 N
**Correct Answer: D. 100 N**
**Explanation:** The tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the mass. Weight = mg = 10 kg * 10 m/s² = 100 N.  Understanding forces in equilibrium is critical for the MCAT.


**10. An object is in translational equilibrium. Which of the following must be true?**
A. The object is at rest.
B. The net force on the object is zero.
C. The object is not accelerating.
D. Both B and C.
**Correct Answer: D. Both B and C.**
**Explanation:** Translational equilibrium means the net force acting on the object is zero. This implies that the object is either at rest or moving at a constant velocity (no acceleration).


**11. Which of the following is a vector quantity?**
A. Speed
B. Mass
C. Acceleration
D. Energy
**Correct Answer: C. Acceleration**
**Explanation:** Acceleration is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction. Speed, mass, and energy are scalar quantities (magnitude only).


**12. A car accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 5 seconds. What is its average acceleration?**
A. 100 m/s²
B. 4 m/s²
C. 25 m/s²
D. 0 m/s²
**Correct Answer: B. 4 m/s²**
**Explanation:** Average acceleration = (change in velocity) / (change in time) = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 5 s = 4 m/s².


**13. In projectile motion, which component of velocity remains constant (ignoring air resistance)?**
A. Vertical component
B. Horizontal component
C. Both components
D. Neither component
**Correct Answer: B. Horizontal component**
**Explanation:** Ignoring air resistance, only the horizontal component of velocity remains constant in projectile motion.  The vertical component changes due to gravity.


**14. A 5 kg object moving at 10 m/s collides with a stationary 10 kg object. Assuming a perfectly inelastic collision, what is the approximate final velocity of the two objects?**
A. 10 m/s
B. 3.33 m/s
C. 5 m/s
D. 0 m/s
**Correct Answer: B. 3.33 m/s**
**Explanation:** In a perfectly inelastic collision, momentum is conserved.  Initial momentum = (5 kg)(10 m/s) + (10 kg)(0 m/s) = 50 kg*m/s.  Final momentum = (5 kg + 10 kg) * v.  Setting initial and final momentum equal: 50 kg*m/s = 15 kg * v.  Solving for v: v ≈ 3.33 m/s.


**15. What is the term for the force that opposes the motion of an object sliding across a surface?**
A. Normal force
B. Gravitational force
C. Kinetic friction
D. Static friction
**Correct Answer: C. Kinetic friction**
**Explanation:** Kinetic friction is the force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are already in relative motion.  Static friction opposes the *initiation* of motion.
