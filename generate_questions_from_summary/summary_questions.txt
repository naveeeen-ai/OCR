B. Only the direction changes, while magnitude remains the same
C. Both magnitude and direction change
D. Neither magnitude nor direction changes

B. When the surfaces are not in contact
C. When the surfaces are at rest relative to each other
D. When there is no force attempting to move the surfaces

B. When the surfaces are moving together at the same velocity
C. When the surfaces are moving relative to each other
D. When no force is applied to the surfaces

C. The object must also be in rotational equilibrium.
D. The object experiences a constant nonzero acceleration.
Answer: B. The object has zero net force acting on it and moves with constant velocity.
Explanation: Translational equilibrium means the vector sum of all forces is zero, so the object’s velocity is constant (which may be zero or nonzero); rotational equilibrium is a separate condition.
