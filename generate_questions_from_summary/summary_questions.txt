**1. Which of the following is NOT a base SI unit?**
A. Ampere
B. Liter
C. Kelvin
D. Mole
**Correct Answer: B. Liter**
**Explanation:** The International System of Units (SI) has seven base units: meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), kelvin (thermodynamic temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity).  The liter is a derived unit, equal to a cubic decimeter (dm³),  making it a unit of volume. Understanding the distinction between base and derived units is important for dimensional analysis on the MCAT.

**2. Which of the following best describes a vector quantity?**
A. A quantity with only a numerical value.
B. A quantity with both magnitude and direction.
C. A quantity that describes temperature.
D. A quantity that represents time.
**Correct Answer: B. A quantity with both magnitude and direction.**
**Explanation:**  Vector quantities possess both magnitude (size or amount) and direction.  This is in contrast to scalar quantities, which only have magnitude.  Velocity, displacement, force, and acceleration are examples of vector quantities.  The MCAT frequently tests the ability to distinguish between vector and scalar quantities and their implications in problem-solving.

**3. Which of the following is a characteristic of a scalar quantity?**
A. It has both magnitude and direction.
B. It describes acceleration.
C. It has only magnitude.
D. It is always represented by a vector.
**Correct Answer: C. It has only magnitude.**
**Explanation:** Scalar quantities are fully described by their magnitude (size) alone.  Examples include mass, speed, temperature, and time.  This contrasts with vector quantities, which require both magnitude and direction for complete description.  Understanding this difference is crucial for proper representation and manipulation of physical quantities on the MCAT.

**4. Displacement is best characterized as:**
A. The total distance traveled.
B. A vector quantity indicating the change in position.
C. A scalar quantity representing the path length.
D. The instantaneous rate of change in position.
**Correct Answer: B. A vector quantity indicating the change in position.**
**Explanation:** Displacement is a vector that represents the shortest distance between an object's initial and final positions. It's independent of the path taken.  Distance, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity representing the total path length.  This distinction is vital for understanding the difference between displacement and distance, especially in kinematic problems on the MCAT.

**5. Distance is best described as:**
A. A vector quantity representing the change in position.
B. The total path length traveled.
C. The rate of change of displacement.
D. The change in velocity over time.
**Correct Answer: B. The total path length traveled.**
**Explanation:** Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total length of the path traveled by an object. It does not consider direction, only the magnitude of the path.  This contrasts with displacement, which only considers the initial and final positions.  The MCAT may present problems where understanding this distinction is key to correctly solving the problem.


**6. Velocity can be conceptually understood as:**
A. The total distance traveled divided by the time taken.
B. The rate of change of speed.
C. The vector rate of change of displacement.
D. A scalar quantity representing the rate of motion.
**Correct Answer: C. The vector rate of change of displacement.**
**Explanation:** Velocity is a vector quantity that describes the rate of change of an object's displacement over time.  It includes both magnitude (speed) and direction.  Option A describes average speed, not velocity. Option B is incorrect because the rate of change of speed is not necessarily velocity (it could be acceleration).  Understanding this vector nature is crucial for many MCAT physics topics.

**7. Speed is fundamentally related to velocity in which way?**
A. Speed is the vector representation of velocity.
B. Speed is the direction of velocity.
C. Speed is the magnitude of velocity.
D. Speed and velocity are unrelated concepts.
**Correct Answer: C. Speed is the magnitude of velocity.**
**Explanation:** Speed is the scalar magnitude of the velocity vector.  Velocity contains both speed and direction; speed is simply the 'how fast' part, ignoring the 'which way'. This conceptual understanding is fundamental to solving many physics problems on the MCAT.

**8. Average velocity is defined as:**
A. The total distance divided by the total time.
B. The instantaneous velocity at a specific time.
C. The total displacement divided by the total time.
D. The change in velocity over time.
**Correct Answer: C. The total displacement divided by the total time.**
**Explanation:** Average velocity is a vector quantity calculated by dividing the total displacement (change in position, a vector) by the total time taken. It's a measure of the average rate of change in position.  Option A describes average speed, and option D describes average acceleration.  The MCAT frequently tests the understanding of average vs. instantaneous quantities.


**9. Average speed is defined as:**
A. The total displacement divided by the total time.
B. The total distance divided by the total time.
C. The vector rate of change of displacement.
D. The instantaneous speed at a given moment.
**Correct Answer: B. The total distance divided by the total time.**
**Explanation:** Average speed is a scalar quantity, calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Unlike average velocity, it does not consider direction. This difference is important for MCAT problem-solving, particularly in situations involving changes in direction.


**10. Instantaneous velocity is conceptually defined as:**
A. The average velocity over a long period.
B. The limit of the change in displacement divided by the change in time, as the change in time approaches zero.
C. The total displacement divided by the total time.
D. The speed at any given moment.
**Correct Answer: B. The limit of the change in displacement divided by the change in time, as the change in time approaches zero.**
**Explanation:** Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific instant in time.  Mathematically, it's the derivative of displacement with respect to time. This concept is crucial for understanding calculus-based physics and is often tested on the MCAT.

**11. Instantaneous speed is best described as:**
A. The average speed over a period of time.
B. The magnitude of instantaneous velocity.
C. The direction of instantaneous velocity.
D. The total distance divided by the total time.
**Correct Answer: B. The magnitude of instantaneous velocity.**
**Explanation:** Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vector at a given moment. It represents the rate of motion at that precise instant, without regard to direction.

**12. A force, in its most fundamental definition, is:**
A. An object in motion.
B. A push or pull that can cause acceleration.
C. The measure of an object's inertia.
D. The energy possessed by an object.
**Correct Answer: B. A push or pull that can cause acceleration.**
**Explanation:** A force is an interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object.  This change in motion is acceleration.  This is a key concept related to Newton's second law (F=ma).  The MCAT often requires understanding force as the agent of change in motion.

**13. Gravity is best described as:**
A. A repulsive force between masses.
B. A force that opposes motion between surfaces.
C. An attractive force between masses.
D. A force that causes objects to move at a constant speed.
**Correct Answer: C. An attractive force between masses.**
**Explanation:** Gravity is a fundamental force of attraction between any two objects with mass. The strength of this attraction increases with the mass of the objects and decreases with the square of the distance between them (Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation). This is essential knowledge for the MCAT.

**14. Friction is fundamentally a force that:**
A. Aids motion between surfaces.
B. Opposes motion due to surface interactions.
C. Always acts perpendicular to a surface.
D. Is independent of surface properties.
**Correct Answer: B. Opposes motion due to surface interactions.**
**Explanation:** Friction is a force that resists the relative motion of surfaces in contact.  It arises from microscopic irregularities and intermolecular forces between surfaces.  Understanding friction is crucial for many MCAT physics problems involving forces and motion.

**15. Static friction acts on objects that are:**
A. In motion relative to each other.
B. At rest relative to each other.
C. Accelerating relative to each other.
D. Moving at constant velocity relative to each other.
**Correct Answer: B. At rest relative to each other.**
**Explanation:** Static friction acts to prevent the initiation of motion between two surfaces at rest relative to each other.  Once motion begins, kinetic friction takes over.  Understanding the conditions under which static friction acts is important for the MCAT.

**16. Kinetic friction acts on objects that are:**
A. At rest relative to each other.
B. In motion relative to each other.
C. Experiencing no relative motion.
D. Only moving vertically.
**Correct Answer: B. In motion relative to each other.**
**Explanation:** Kinetic friction, also known as sliding friction, opposes motion between two surfaces that are already moving relative to one another.  It's generally less than static friction for the same surfaces.

**17. How does kinetic friction differ fundamentally from static friction?**
A. Kinetic friction varies with applied force; static friction is constant.
B. Kinetic friction is always greater than static friction.
C. Kinetic friction is constant; static friction varies with applied force.
D. Kinetic and static friction are always equal.
**Correct Answer: C. Kinetic friction is constant; static friction varies with applied force.**
**Explanation:**  Static friction adjusts its magnitude to match the applied force up to a maximum value (the static friction maximum). Once motion begins, kinetic friction becomes a constant value, generally less than the maximum static friction.


**18. The coefficient of friction is primarily dependent on:**
A. The mass of the objects involved.
B. The velocity of the objects involved.
C. The materials in contact.
D. The acceleration of the objects.
**Correct Answer: C. The materials in contact.**
**Explanation:** The coefficient of friction (μ) is a dimensionless constant that depends primarily on the nature of the surfaces in contact.  It's a measure of the "roughness" or interaction between the surfaces.  Mass, velocity, and acceleration do not directly influence the coefficient of friction.

**19. The coefficient of static friction is typically:**
A. Less than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
B. Equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction.
C. Greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
D. Independent of the coefficient of kinetic friction.
**Correct Answer: C. Greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.**
**Explanation:**  It generally requires more force to start an object moving (overcoming static friction) than to keep it moving at a constant velocity (overcoming kinetic friction).  Therefore, the coefficient of static friction is typically larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction for the same materials.

**20. Mass, from a physics perspective, is best understood as:**
A. A measure of an object's weight.
B. A measure of an object's inertia.
C. The force of gravity on an object.
D. The volume occupied by an object.
**Correct Answer: B. A measure of an object's inertia.**
**Explanation:** Mass is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion (inertia).  Weight, on the other hand, is the force of gravity on an object, and is dependent on the local gravitational field.  Mass is an intrinsic property of the object.

**21. Weight, in the context of physics, is:**
A. The amount of matter in an object.
B. The force due to gravity on an object's mass.
C. A measure of an object's resistance to acceleration.
D. The volume of an object.
**Correct Answer: B. The force due to gravity on an object's mass.**
**Explanation:** Weight is the gravitational force acting on an object's mass.  It's a force, and therefore a vector quantity.  It varies depending on the gravitational field strength (e.g., weight is less on the moon than on Earth).

**22. Acceleration is conceptually defined as:**
A. The change in position over time.
B. The vector rate of change of velocity.
C. The total distance traveled divided by the time taken.
D. A scalar quantity representing the rate of motion.
**Correct Answer: B. The vector rate of change of velocity.**
**Explanation:** Acceleration is the vector quantity representing the rate of change of velocity.  A change in velocity's magnitude (speed) or direction constitutes acceleration.  This is crucial for understanding Newton's second law.


**23. Newton's First Law of Motion primarily states that:**
A. F=ma
B. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by a net force.
C. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
D. The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it.
**Correct Answer: B. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted on by a net force.**
**Explanation:** Newton's First Law (Inertia) states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

**24. Newton's Second Law of Motion establishes the relationship between:**
A. Velocity and time.
B. Distance and time.
C. Net force, mass, and acceleration.
D. Inertia and momentum.
**Correct Answer: C. Net force, mass, and acceleration.**
**Explanation:** Newton's Second Law (F=ma) states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and its acceleration.  This is a fundamental equation in classical mechanics.

**25. Newton's Third Law of Motion concerns itself with:**
A. The relationship between force and acceleration.
B. The conservation of energy.
C. Action-reaction pairs of forces.
D. The concept of inertia.
**Correct Answer: C. Action-reaction pairs of forces.**
**Explanation:** Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  These forces act on different objects. This is a fundamental concept in understanding interactions between objects.


**26. Linear motion is characterized by:**
A. Perpendicular velocity and acceleration vectors.
B. Velocity and acceleration vectors at an arbitrary angle.
C. Parallel or antiparallel velocity and acceleration vectors.
D. Circular trajectory.
**Correct Answer: C. Parallel or antiparallel velocity and acceleration vectors.**
**Explanation:** In linear motion, the velocity and acceleration vectors are either parallel (for increasing speed) or antiparallel (for decreasing speed) – meaning they are along the same line.

**27. Projectile motion, neglecting air resistance, is predominantly influenced by:**
A.  A variety of forces including air resistance and friction.
B.  The initial velocity and angle of projection, and gravity.
C.  The surface area of the projectile.
D.  The mass and shape of the projectile.
**Correct Answer: B.  The initial velocity and angle of projection, and gravity.**
**Explanation:** In ideal projectile motion (neglecting air resistance), only gravity acts on the projectile. The trajectory is determined solely by the initial velocity (magnitude and direction) and the acceleration due to gravity.

**28. Analysis of motion on an inclined plane primarily involves:**
A. Considering only the vertical component of gravity.
B. Using components parallel and perpendicular to the plane.
C. Ignoring the effects of gravity.
D.  Applying only Newton's first law.
**Correct Answer: B. Using components parallel and perpendicular to the plane.**
**Explanation:**  To analyze motion on an inclined plane, it's crucial to resolve the gravitational force into components parallel and perpendicular to the plane's surface.  The parallel component causes acceleration down the plane, while the perpendicular component is balanced by the normal force.

**29. Uniform circular motion requires a net force that is:**
A. Tangential to the circle.
B. Directed radially outward.
C.  Directed radially inward.
D.  Zero.
**Correct Answer: C.  Directed radially inward.**
**Explanation:**  In uniform circular motion (constant speed), a net force, called the centripetal force, is required to constantly change the direction of the velocity vector. This force is directed towards the center of the circle.

**30. In uniform circular motion, the instantaneous velocity vector is always:**
A. Directed toward the center of the circle.
B. Directed away from the center of the circle.
C. Tangential to the circle.
D.  Perpendicular to the plane of the circle.
**Correct Answer: C. Tangential to the circle.**
**Explanation:** The instantaneous velocity vector in uniform circular motion is always tangent to the circular path at the object's current position.  It's constantly changing direction, but its magnitude (speed) remains constant.

**31. A free body diagram is used to illustrate:**
A. The motion of an object.
B. The forces acting on an object.
C. The energy of an object.
D. The momentum of an object.
**Correct Answer: B. The forces acting on an object.**
**Explanation:** A free body diagram is a simplified representation showing all the forces acting on a single object, often used to analyze forces and motion.

**32. Translational equilibrium is achieved when:**
A. There's a net torque.
B. There's a net force.
C. There's no net force.
D.  There's constant acceleration.
**Correct Answer: C. There's no net force.**
**Explanation:** Translational equilibrium occurs when the net force acting on an object is zero.  This means the object is either at rest or moving at a constant velocity.

**33. An object in translational equilibrium will always have:**
A.  Zero velocity.
B.  Constant velocity.
C. Constant acceleration.
D.  Changing velocity.
**Correct Answer: B.  Constant velocity.**
**Explanation:**  An object in translational equilibrium has no net force acting on it, resulting in constant velocity (which can be zero).

**34. Rotational equilibrium is attained when:**
A.  There's a net force.
B.  There's no net force.
C.  There's no net torque.
D.  There's constant angular acceleration.
**Correct Answer: C.  There's no net torque.**
**Explanation:** Rotational equilibrium means there is no net torque acting on an object, causing it to have a constant angular velocity (which could be zero).

**35. An object in rotational equilibrium maintains:**
A.  Constant angular acceleration.
B.  Changing angular velocity.
C.  Constant angular velocity.
D. Zero angular momentum.
**Correct Answer: C.  Constant angular velocity.**
**Explanation:** Similar to translational equilibrium, rotational equilibrium implies a constant angular velocity (it could be zero or non-zero).


**36. On the MCAT, rotational equilibrium most often implies:**
A. Constant, non-zero angular velocity.
B. Constant angular acceleration.
C. Constant angular velocity (usually zero).
D.  An absence of any rotational motion.
**Correct Answer: C. Constant angular velocity (usually zero).**
**Explanation:** While rotational equilibrium allows for constant non-zero angular velocity, most MCAT problems involving rotational equilibrium deal with situations where the object is at rest, hence zero angular velocity.  The absence of any net torque ensures this constant angular velocity.
