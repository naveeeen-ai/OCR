**1.  A car travels 20 kilometers east and then 15 kilometers north.  Determine the magnitude of its displacement.**
A. 5 km
B. 25 km
C. 35 km
D. 17.7 km
**Correct Answer: D**
**Explanation:** Displacement is the shortest distance between the starting and ending points.  The eastward and northward movements form the legs of a right-angled triangle.  The displacement is the hypotenuse, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: √(20² + 15²) = √(400 + 225) = √625 = 25 km.  The magnitude is 25km.  There appears to be a mistake in the options.  The correct answer should be 25km, but it's not listed.


**2. Identify the vector quantity from the following options.**
A. Speed
B. Mass
C. Acceleration
D. Time
**Correct Answer: C**
**Explanation:** A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. Acceleration has both magnitude (how quickly velocity changes) and direction. Speed, mass, and time are scalar quantities (magnitude only).


**3.  A ball is thrown vertically upward.  Ignoring air resistance, what is its acceleration at its highest point?**
A. 0 m/s²
B. 9.8 m/s² upward
C. 9.8 m/s² downward
D. -9.8 m/s² upward
**Correct Answer: C**
**Explanation:**  Even at its highest point where the velocity is momentarily zero, gravity continues to act on the ball, causing a constant downward acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s².


**4.  An object is in translational equilibrium under which of the following conditions?**
A. It is at rest.
B. It is moving at a constant velocity.
C. The net force acting on it is zero.
D. Both B and C.
**Correct Answer: D**
**Explanation:** Translational equilibrium means the object has no net force acting upon it. This occurs when an object is at rest or moving at a constant velocity (Newton's First Law).


**5.  Calculate the acceleration of a 5-kilogram object experiencing a net force of 10 newtons.**
A. 0.5 m/s²
B. 2 m/s²
C. 50 m/s²
D. 15 m/s²
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Newton's second law states F = ma (Force = mass x acceleration).  Rearranging, a = F/m = 10 N / 5 kg = 2 m/s².


**6.  State Newton's third law of motion.**
A.  F = ma
B. An object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by a net force.
C. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
D. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass.
**Correct Answer: C**
**Explanation:** This is the statement of Newton's third law:  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.


**7.  Calculate the work done when a 20-newton force moves an object 5 meters in the same direction.**
A. 4 Nm
B. 100 J
C. 15 J
D. 25 J
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Work = Force x distance x cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the force and displacement. Since the force and displacement are in the same direction, θ = 0°, and cos(0°) = 1.  Therefore, Work = 20 N x 5 m = 100 J (Joules).


**8.  A projectile is launched at an angle. Describe its velocity at its highest point.**
A. Zero
B. Only horizontal
C. Only vertical
D. Both horizontal and vertical
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** At the highest point, the vertical component of the projectile's velocity is zero. Only the horizontal component remains.


**9.  Generally, how does the magnitude of static friction compare to that of kinetic friction?**
A. Less
B. Greater
C. Equal
D. Unrelated
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Static friction (friction when an object is at rest) is generally greater than kinetic friction (friction when an object is in motion).


**10. What physical quantity is represented by the slope of a velocity-time graph?**
A. Displacement
B. Velocity
C. Acceleration
D. Speed
**Correct Answer: C**
**Explanation:** The slope of a velocity-time graph represents the change in velocity over time, which is the definition of acceleration.


**11.  Determine the momentum of a 10-kilogram object moving at 5 meters per second.**
A. 2 kg⋅m/s
B. 50 kg⋅m/s
C. 25 kg⋅m/s
D. 15 kg⋅m/s
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Momentum (p) = mass (m) x velocity (v) = 10 kg x 5 m/s = 50 kg⋅m/s


**12.  In uniform circular motion, specify the direction of the acceleration.**
A. Tangential to the circle
B. Towards the center of the circle
C. Away from the center of the circle
D. Opposite to the velocity
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** The acceleration in uniform circular motion is called centripetal acceleration, and it always points towards the center of the circle.


**13.  What is the result of the dot product of two vectors when the angle between them is 90 degrees?**
A. The product of their magnitudes
B. Zero
C. The product of their magnitudes and the sine of the angle
D. The product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** The dot product of two vectors is defined as A.B = |A||B|cos(θ). When θ = 90°, cos(90°) = 0, making the dot product zero.


**14.  Which of the following scenarios exemplifies rotational equilibrium?**
A. A spinning top
B. A balanced seesaw
C. A rolling ball
D. A freely falling object
**Correct Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Rotational equilibrium means the net torque acting on an object is zero. A balanced seesaw has zero net torque.  The other options involve rotation and thus, are not in rotational equilibrium.


**15.  Calculate the acceleration of a car that accelerates from rest to 20 meters per second in 5 seconds.**
A. 4 m/s²
B. 100 m/s²
C. 5 m/s²
D. 0.25 m/s²
**Correct Answer: A**
**Explanation:** Acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 5 s = 4 m/s².
