**1. A projectile is launched at an initial velocity of 20 m/s at a 30° angle above the horizontal.  Neglecting air resistance, what is the approximate vertical component of its initial velocity?**
A. 10 m/s
B. 17.3 m/s
C. 20 m/s
D. 0 m/s
**Correct Answer: A. 10 m/s**
**Explanation:** The vertical component of the initial velocity is given by v₀sinθ, where v₀ is the initial velocity (20 m/s) and θ is the launch angle (30°).  Therefore, the vertical component is 20 m/s * sin(30°) = 20 m/s * 0.5 = 10 m/s.

**2. A 5 kg object is subject to a net force of 10 N.  What is its acceleration, according to Newton's second law of motion?**
A. 0.5 m/s²
B. 2 m/s²
C. 5 m/s²
D. 50 m/s²
**Correct Answer: B. 2 m/s²**
**Explanation:** Newton's second law states F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.  Solving for acceleration, a = F/m = 10 N / 5 kg = 2 m/s².

**3. Two objects, one with mass m and the other with mass 2m, are released from the same height in a vacuum. Which object reaches the ground first?**
A. The object with mass m
B. The object with mass 2m
C. They hit the ground simultaneously.
D.  It depends on the shape of the objects.
**Correct Answer: C. They hit the ground simultaneously.**
**Explanation:** In a vacuum, there is no air resistance.  The acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects regardless of their mass.  Therefore, both objects will fall at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time.

**4. A car travels 100 km in 2 hours.  Calculate its average speed.**
A. 200 km/hr
B. 50 km/hr
C. 25 km/hr
D. 100 km/hr
**Correct Answer: B. 50 km/hr**
**Explanation:** Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time.  Average speed = 100 km / 2 hours = 50 km/hr.

**5. A block rests on an inclined plane.  Identify the force preventing the block from sliding downward.**
A.  Kinetic friction
B.  Gravity
C.  Normal force
D.  Static friction
**Correct Answer: D. Static friction**
**Explanation:** Static friction is the force that opposes the initiation of motion between two surfaces in contact.  Since the block is at rest, it's static friction that prevents it from sliding down the inclined plane.

**6. Determine the dot product of vectors A = (3i + 4j) and B = (2i - j), where i and j represent unit vectors.**
A. 2
B. 10
C. 5i - j
D. 6i - 4j
**Correct Answer: A. 2**
**Explanation:** The dot product is calculated by multiplying corresponding components and summing the results: (3 * 2) + (4 * -1) = 6 - 4 = 2.

**7. A ball is thrown vertically upward. At its apex, what is its instantaneous velocity?**
A.  Zero
B.  Equal to its initial velocity
C.  Equal to the acceleration due to gravity
D.  Undefined
**Correct Answer: A. Zero**
**Explanation:** At the apex (highest point) of its trajectory, the ball momentarily stops before changing direction.  Its instantaneous velocity at that point is zero.

**8.  What principle accounts for the outward force experienced by a person riding a merry-go-round?**
A.  Centripetal force
B.  Centrifugal force
C.  Inertia
D.  Gravitational force
**Correct Answer: C. Inertia**
**Explanation:** The outward force is not a real force but an apparent force due to inertia. The person's inertia causes them to want to continue moving in a straight line, while the merry-go-round forces them into a circular path.  Centripetal force is the real force causing the circular motion (directed towards the center).

**9. A 10 kg mass is suspended from a rope.  Assuming g = 10 m/s², determine the tension in the rope.**
A. 0 N
B. 1 N
C. 10 N
D. 100 N
**Correct Answer: D. 100 N**
**Explanation:** The tension in the rope must balance the weight of the mass. Weight = mg = 10 kg * 10 m/s² = 100 N.

**10.  An object is in a state of translational equilibrium.  Which statement must be true?**
A.  The object is at rest.
B.  The net force on the object is zero.
C.  The object is not accelerating.
D.  Both B and C.
**Correct Answer: D. Both B and C.**
**Explanation:** Translational equilibrium means the net force acting on the object is zero.  This implies the object is not accelerating (Newton's first law).  The object could be at rest or moving at a constant velocity.

**11.  Identify the following quantity as a vector or scalar: acceleration.**
A.  Speed
B.  Mass
C.  Acceleration
D.  Energy
**Correct Answer: C. Acceleration**
**Explanation:** Acceleration is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction.

**12.  A car accelerates uniformly from rest to a final velocity of 20 m/s over 5 seconds. Determine its average acceleration.**
A. 100 m/s²
B. 4 m/s²
C. 25 m/s²
D. 0 m/s²
**Correct Answer: B. 4 m/s²**
**Explanation:** Average acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 5 s = 4 m/s².

**13. In projectile motion, neglecting air resistance, which velocity component remains constant?**
A.  Vertical component
B.  Horizontal component
C.  Both components
D.  Neither component
**Correct Answer: B. Horizontal component**
**Explanation:** Neglecting air resistance, only gravity acts on the projectile in the vertical direction.  The horizontal velocity remains constant because there is no horizontal force.

**14. A 5 kg object moving at 10 m/s undergoes a perfectly inelastic collision with a stationary 10 kg object.  What is the approximate final velocity of the combined system?**
A. 10 m/s
B. 3.33 m/s
C. 5 m/s
D. 0 m/s
**Correct Answer: B. 3.33 m/s**
**Explanation:**  Conservation of momentum: (5 kg)(10 m/s) + (10 kg)(0 m/s) = (5 kg + 10 kg)v_f. Solving for v_f (final velocity): v_f = 3.33 m/s.

**15. What is the name of the force that resists the motion of an object sliding across a surface?**
A.  Normal force
B.  Gravitational force
C.  Kinetic friction
D.  Static friction
**Correct Answer: C. Kinetic friction**
**Explanation:** Kinetic friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object already sliding across a surface.  Static friction opposes the *initiation* of motion.
