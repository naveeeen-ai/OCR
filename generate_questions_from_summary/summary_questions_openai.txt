A. The coefficient of static friction is always less than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
B. The coefficient of static friction is always equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction.
C. The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
D. The coefficients of friction are unrelated to each other.
Answer: C. The coefficient of static friction is always greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction.
Explanation: For any two materials in contact, the coefficient of static friction exceeds that of kinetic friction, reflecting the greater force required to initiate motion compared to maintaining it.

22b. A block rests on a wooden table. Which change would most likely increase the coefficient of friction between the block and the table?
A. Replacing the wooden block with a rubber block
B. Increasing the mass of the block
C. Increasing the surface area of contact
D. Pushing the block faster across the table
Answer: A. Replacing the wooden block with a rubber block
Explanation: The coefficient of friction depends on the nature of the materials in contact; rubber generally has a higher coefficient of friction with wood than wood does with wood.

22c. Why is it generally more difficult to initiate the motion of a stationary object than to keep it moving at constant speed?
A. Because kinetic friction is always greater than static friction
B. Because static friction is always greater than kinetic friction
C. Because friction does not depend on the materials in contact
D. Because friction increases with speed
Answer: B. Because static friction is always greater than kinetic friction
Explanation: The maximum static frictional force exceeds the kinetic frictional force, so more force is required to overcome static friction and start motion than to maintain motion.

A. Centripetal force, acting radially inward
B. Centrifugal force, acting radially outward
C. Gravitational force, acting tangentially
D. Normal force, acting perpendicular to the motion
Answer: A. Centripetal force, acting radially inward
Explanation: The centripetal force is the net force that always points toward the center of the circle, keeping the object in its circular path.

33c. A student claims that in uniform circular motion, there must be a tangential force to maintain constant speed. Which of the following best evaluates this claim?
A. Correct, because tangential force is needed to keep the object moving
B. Incorrect, because only a radial (centripetal) force is needed for constant speed
C. Correct, because tangential force balances the centripetal force
D. Incorrect, because no forces are required in circular motion
Answer: B. Incorrect, because only a radial (centripetal) force is needed for constant speed
