A. The acceleration is constant and nonzero
B. The acceleration is changing
C. The acceleration is zero
D. The acceleration is negative

A. The dependence of acceleration on the direction of velocity
B. The inverse relationship between mass and acceleration for a given force
C. The independence of force from acceleration

A. They must always be perpendicular
B. They must always be parallel or antiparallel
C. They must always be equal in magnitude

A. Free fall near Earth's surface
B. Projectile motion in two dimensions
C. An elevator moving upward at constant speed
D. A stone dropped from a bridge

A. Both gravity and a constant horizontal force act on the projectile
B. Only gravity acts on the projectile
C. Gravity and a varying vertical force act on the projectile

B. Both horizontal and vertical accelerations are constant and nonzero
C. Acceleration is constant and directed downward in the vertical (y) direction only
D. Acceleration is zero throughout the motion

A. An object moves under the influence of gravity alone
B. An object experiences a force of air resistance during flight
C. An object is launched with both horizontal and vertical velocity components

B. The claim is incorrect because only a radial (centripetal) force is required.
C. The claim is correct because both radial and tangential forces are always needed.
D. The claim is incorrect because no forces are required in circular motion.
Answer: B. The claim is incorrect because only a radial (centripetal) force is required.

B. To represent all forces acting on an object in isolation
C. To calculate the acceleration of an object directly

B. Gravitational force and frictional force
C. Gravitational force, normal force, and frictional force
D. Gravitational force, normal force, frictional force, and the block's velocity
Answer: C. Gravitational force, normal force, and frictional force

A. The diagram should not include the normal force
B. The diagram should not include friction
C. The diagram should not include a “motion” force, as motion is not a force
D. The diagram should not include the car’s weight
Answer: C. The diagram should not include a “motion” force, as motion is not a force

B. A book resting motionless on a table.
C. A ball accelerating down an inclined plane.
D. A satellite moving at constant speed in a circular orbit (ignoring rotation).

B. A net centripetal force acts toward the center of the circle, causing a change in velocity direction.
C. The car experiences a net force in the direction of its motion.
D. The only force acting on the car is gravity.
Answer: B. A net centripetal force acts toward the center of the circle, causing a change in velocity direction.
Explanation: Even at constant speed, the car’s changing direction means there is a net centripetal force, demonstrating the distinction between speed and velocity in dynamics.

40c. Which scenario best illustrates the concept of acceleration as it relates to kinematics?
A. A runner maintains a steady pace in a straight line.
B. A cyclist slows down as they approach a stop sign.
C. A train moves at constant velocity along a straight track.
D. A ball remains motionless on a flat surface.
Answer: B. A cyclist slows down as they approach a stop sign.
Explanation: Acceleration refers to any change in velocity (magnitude or direction); slowing down is negative acceleration (deceleration), exemplifying this concept.
