This distinction is fundamental in kinematics and dynamics.</pre></div><div class="mcq"><pre>2b. A student claims that because temperature can be represented with a positive or negative sign (e.g., –10°C), it must be a vector quantity. Which of the following best addresses the flaw in this reasoning?
A. Temperature lacks a spatial direction, which is required for vector classification.
B. The sign in temperature indicates relative scale, not direction in space.
C. Vectors must be represented graphically with arrows, whereas temperature is a numerical value.
D. Only quantities involving motion (e.g., velocity) can be vectors, and temperature is static.
Answer: B. The sign in temperature indicates relative scale, not direction in space.
Explanation: Vectors require a *spatial* direction (e.g., north, upward), not merely algebraic sign. Temperature’s sign reflects a reference point (e.g., below freezing) but no directional component.</pre></div><div class="mcq"><pre>2c. In a two-dimensional motion problem, why must acceleration be treated as a vector when analyzing projectile motion?
A. Acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, requiring directional specificity.
B. Projectile motion involves curved paths, which can only be described using vector calculus.
C. The horizontal and vertical components of acceleration are independent and must be resolved separately.
D. Vectors are necessary to distinguish between constant acceleration and uniformly changing velocity.
Answer: A. Acceleration due to gravity acts only in the vertical direction, requiring directional specificity.
Explanation: In projectile motion, acceleration is exclusively downward (ignoring air resistance), so its *direction* (a vector property) is critical for resolving motion into horizontal and vertical components. Scalar treatment would omit this directional dependence.</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td class="col-sno">3</td><td class="col-point">Scalars are quantities without direction.

A. Work
B. Electric Potential
C. Torque

A. The speed is unchanged.
B. The speed is doubled.
C. The speed is halved.
D. The speed depends on the direction of the velocity.

B. Only the direction of the vector changes.
C. Both the magnitude and direction of the vector change.
D. Neither the magnitude nor the direction of the vector changes.

A displacement vector is multiplied by a scalar value. Under which of the following conditions will the magnitude of the resultant displacement vector be decreased compared to the initial displacement vector?
A. The scalar is any positive number greater than 1.
B. The scalar is any negative number less than -1.
C. The scalar is any positive number less than 1.
D. The scalar is exactly 1.
Answer: C. The scalar is any positive number less than 1.

An object's motion is graphed as its position versus time. Which aspect of the graph directly corresponds to the object's average velocity over a given time interval?
A. The area under the curve.

B. It is greater than zero.
C. It is equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.
D. It is zero.

B. The average speed of Runner B is greater because they had a lower instantaneous speed at the finish line.
C. The average speeds are equal because the displacement is the same for both runners.
D. The average speed cannot be determined without knowing the instantaneous speeds at various points in the race.
Answer: A. The average speed of Runner A is greater because they covered the same distance in less time.

C. The average speed is 0.5 m/s.
D. The average speed is less than the magnitude of the average velocity.
Answer: C. The average speed is 0.5 m/s.
Explanation: Average speed is total distance (5+5+5 = 15m) divided by total time (30s), so 15m/30s = 0.5 m/s.

A block is at rest on an inclined plane. Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the component of gravitational force parallel to the plane (Fₚ) and the frictional force (fₛ) acting on the block?
A. Fₚ is greater than fₛ, causing the block to accelerate down the plane.
B. Fₛ is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to Fₚ, maintaining equilibrium.
C. Fₛ is independent of Fₚ and depends only on the coefficient of static friction.
D. Fₚ and fₛ act in the same direction, both opposing motion.
