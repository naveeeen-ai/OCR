**Question 1**

If the amount of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, is increased, which of the following would likely be the result?
A. Weakness of muscle movements
B. Excessive pain or discomfort
C. Mood swings and mood instability
D. Auditory and visual hallucinations
Weakness of muscle movements
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter crucial for muscle contraction. Acetylcholinesterase breaks it down, terminating the signal. Increased acetylcholinesterase would lead to quicker breakdown of acetylcholine, resulting in weaker muscle contractions and ultimately, weakness of muscle movements.


**Question 2**

The adrenal glands do all of the following EXCEPT:
A. promote the fight-or-flight response via estrogen.
B. produce stress responses via cortisol.
C. produce both hormones and neurotransmitters.
D. release estrogen in males and testosterone in females.
A. promote the fight-or-flight response via estrogen.
The adrenal glands are crucial for the fight-or-flight response, primarily mediated by epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), not estrogen.  While the adrenal glands produce some sex hormones, their primary role in the fight-or-flight response is through the catecholamines.


**Question 3**

A disorder of the pineal gland would most likely result in which of the following disorders?
A. High blood pressure
B. Diabetes
C. Insomnia
D. Hyperthyroidism
C. Insomnia
The pineal gland produces melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. A disorder affecting the pineal gland could disrupt melatonin production, leading to insomnia or other sleep disturbances.


**Question 4**

Which of the following neurotransmitters is associated with both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease?
A. GABA
B. Serotonin
C. Dopamine
D. Enkephalins
C. Dopamine
Dopamine imbalances are implicated in both schizophrenia (excess dopamine activity in certain brain regions) and Parkinson's disease (deficiency of dopamine in specific brain areas).


**Question 5**

In a personality survey, which set of twins would be expected to score most similarly?
A. Identical twins raised in different homes
B. Fraternal twins raised in different homes
C. Identical twins raised in the same home
D. Fraternal twins raised in the same home
C. Identical twins raised in the same home
Identical (monozygotic) twins share 100% of their genes. While environment plays a role, their genetic similarity makes them more likely to have similar personality traits than fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share only about 50% of their genes.  Being raised in the same home further minimizes environmental differences.


**Question 6**

During a physical examination, a physician brushes the bottom of the foot of a fifty-year-old patient with multiple sclerosis. Her toes are observed to curl toward the bottom of her foot, with no fanning of the toes. This response is:
A. abnormal, and evidence that she is exhibiting a primitive reflex.
B. normal, and evidence that she is exhibiting a primitive reflex.
C. abnormal, and evidence that she is not exhibiting a primitive reflex.
D. normal, and evidence that she is not exhibiting a primitive reflex.
A. abnormal, and evidence that she is exhibiting a primitive reflex.
The description indicates a positive Babinski reflex, where the toes curl downward instead of fanning out.  This is a primitive reflex normally present in infants but absent in adults.  Its presence in an adult is abnormal and often indicative of neurological damage, consistent with multiple sclerosis.


**Question 7**

Which of the following fine motor tasks would one expect to see first in an infant?
A. Grasping for objects with two fingers
B. Following objects with the eyes
C. Scribbling with a crayon
D. Moving a toy from one hand to the other
B. Following objects with the eyes
Following objects with the eyes (visual tracking) is a very early developing visual-motor skill in infants, preceding the development of more refined hand-eye coordination needed for grasping, scribbling, or transferring objects between hands.
